UNIT al5image;
(*<This unit registers bitmap format handlers for @link(al_load_bitmap), @link(al_load_bitmap_f), @link(al_save_bitmap), @link(al_save_bitmap_f).

   The following types are built into the Allegro image addon and guaranteed to be available: BMP, PCX, TGA. Every platform also supports JPEG and PNG via external dependencies.

   Other formats may be available depending on the operating system and installed libraries, but are not guaranteed and should not be assumed to be universally available. *)
