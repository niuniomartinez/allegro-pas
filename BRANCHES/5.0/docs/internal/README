VAR parameters
==============

  Some parameters that are pointers in C are implemented in Pascal as VAR parameters.

  Some other are still pointers.



Unimplemented headers
=====================

  config.h
  --------

  Object Pascal defines the class TStrings that implements similar
  functionality.



  file.h fshook.h
  ---------------

  Not at the moment.  May be if somebody ask for it or I find a real use.



  fixed.h fmaths.h
  ----------------

  Not at the moment.



  memory.h
  --------

  It uses C preprocesor and I don't know if it's possible to reproduce its
  functionality using Pascal.



  path.h
  ------

  As I see, Free Pascal RTL has same functionality.
