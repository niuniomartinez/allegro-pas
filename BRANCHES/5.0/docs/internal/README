Data types
==========

  Texts are managed in two different types:

  When used as parameter, they're defined as STRING assuming they're ANSISTRING.
  An exception are CALLBACKs.

  If a function returns a text, it's defined as PCHAR.  May be it should bee
  ANSISTRING too.



parameters
==========

  Some parameters that are pointers in C are implemented in Pascal as VAR
  parameters.  Some other are still pointers.

  Text parameters are defined as STRING assuming they're ANSISTRING.
  An exception are CALLBACKs.



Unimplemented headers
=====================

  config.h
  --------

  Object Pascal defines the class TStrings that implements similar
  functionality.



  file.h fshook.h
  ---------------

  Not at the moment.  May be if somebody ask for it or I find a real use.



  fixed.h fmaths.h
  ----------------

  Not at the moment.



  memory.h
  --------

  It uses C preprocesor and I don't know if it's possible to reproduce its
  functionality using Pascal.



  path.h
  ------

  As I see, Free Pascal RTL has same functionality.



  threads.h
  ---------

  Free Pascal has TThread class.  May be it's enough.
