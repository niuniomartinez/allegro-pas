Data types
==========

  Data types on Pascal behaves different than C.  Actually FPC activates some
  microprocessor exception mode to prevent/clamp/convert/whatever some data,
  or it does with Intel x86 family.  As result of an Allegro.cc thread[1] this
  affects the work of Allegro.


THE REST OF THE FILE IS A MESS AND SHOULD BE FIXED!

  Texts are managed in two different types:

  When used as parameter, they're defined as STRING assuming they're ANSISTRING.
  An exception are CALLBACKs.

  If a function returns a text, it's defined as PCHAR.  May be it should bee
  ANSISTRING too.

  Free Pascal optimizes "enumeration" type sizes.  They MUST be 4 bytes long.



parameters
==========

  Some parameters that are pointers in C are implemented in Pascal as VAR
  parameters.  Some other are still pointers.

  Text parameters are defined as STRING assuming they're ANSISTRING.
  An exception are CALLBACKs.



Unimplemented headers
=====================

  config.h
  --------

  Object Pascal defines the class TStrings that implements similar
  functionality.



  file.h fshook.h
  ---------------

  Not at the moment.  May be if somebody ask for it or I find a real use.



  fixed.h fmaths.h
  ----------------

  Not at the moment.



  memory.h
  --------

  It uses C preprocesor and I don't know if it's possible to reproduce its
  functionality using Pascal.



  path.h
  ------

  As I see, Free Pascal RTL has same functionality.  May be it should be added
  for Delphi.



  threads.h
  ---------

  IIRC both Free Pascal and Delphi have TThread class.
