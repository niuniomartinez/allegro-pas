@section(1 intro Introduction)

  Allegro.pas is a wrapper to allow Pascal compilers (such as Free Pascal or
  Delphi) to use the Allegro library.

  @bold(This version is an early Work In Progress version for the new Allegro5
  API.) You @bold(must) assume that it is uncomplete, unstable and that
  anything would change without previous notification. Anyway I encorage you
  to test it and help in the development, from testing to coding. In any case,
  @link(contact contact me) before to start doing anything just to know what
  you can do.

@section(1 use_allegro How to use Allegro.pas)

  Since this is a WIP version, it isn't so strightforward as the previous
  stable versions are. If you haven't any previous experience with Allegro.pas,
  please try using Allegro.pas 4.4.3.  Version 5 installs almost the same way.

  Note that this version uses a whole new API slightly different than the
  previous one.

  You must build the documentation by yourself.  You must use the pasdoc
  utility and the makefile provided in the ./docs/manual directory.
