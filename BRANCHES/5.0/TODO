In no special order

  * Add to documentation a note about to define symbol "DEBUGMODE" if using
    "-g".

  * There are some "enum" types (sets). Be sure that they have the correct
    sice in bits.  Read FPC and Delphi help.

  * Documentation isn't written.
    May be I should find another documentation tool as pasdoc is "dirty".
    Else use pasdoc.

  * Document COLOR issue (can't use functions "_map_" as parameters in
    Windows (?)).

  * MUST normalize types (VAR vs. POINTER, OUT vs. VAR, STRING vs. PCHAR ...).
