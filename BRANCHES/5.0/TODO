In no special order

  * There are some "enum" types (sets). Be sure that they have the correct
    sice in bits.  Read FPC and Delphi help.

  * Documentation isn't written.
    May be I should find another documentation tool as pasdoc is "dirty".

  * Test if it's possible to use STRING (ANSISTRING) as return values
    instead of PCHAR.
