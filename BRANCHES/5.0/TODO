In no special order

  * Something prevents to exit at al_uninstall_system.  Fix it!

  * Header "timer.h" is short enough to translate in a single step.

  * Lots of documentation aren't written.

  * Currently, all enums are implemented as CONST.  Som of these enums have
    name and are implemented as LONGINT.  Ask and/or test if it's possible to
    implement enums as sets.

  * Test if it's possible to change parameters with pointers in to VAR
    or OUT paramaeters:
      al4font.al_get_text_dimensions
      allegro5.al_wait_for_event
