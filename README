Introduction
============

  Allegro.pas is a wrapper that allows Pascal compilers (such as Free Pascal
  and Delphi) to use the Allegro library.

  Note that Allegro 5 is wholly *incompatible* with Allegro 4 and earlier
  versions, and so Allegro.pas is, but both may be installed at the same time
  without conflicts.

  This is a beta version of the Allegro.pas 5 version.  It is released to show
  what's done and to allow developers to test it and give feed-back.  Please go
  to the Allegro.pas' project site at SourceForge or GitHub to know about
  progress and know when new versions are released.

  Current version was tested with Free Pascal on WindowsXP, Windows7 and
  GNU/Linux, both 32bit and 64 bit, and with Delphi 10.3 Community Edition on
  Windows 7 32bit.  Other operating systems and compilers weren't tested.

  The goal is to make Allegro.pas 5 compatible with all operating system
  supported by Allegro.  Right now it works on Windows and Linux.

  As this is a WIP version you should remember that at the moment not all
  functionality are implemented.

====================
Installation and use
====================

  Installation and use are different depending on the operating system and
  compiler you're using.  To make things more easy I've wrote different
  documents for each one you can find in the ~/docs/build directory.  For
  example, read "windows.txt to know how to get and install Allegro in your
  Windows system, then read "lazarus.txt" to know how to use it with Lazarus
  IDE.

  For Lazarus and Free Pascal users it is recommendable to read the
  "makefile.txt" file too.



Documentation
=============

  You can build it (read ~/docs/build/make.txt) or download it from the webpage
  (see Contact info).  You can also read it on-line from SourceForge:
  http://allegro-pas.sourceforge.net/docs/5.2/

  Also, there are a collection of examples and a demonstration game.  Open them
  and read the code.  Some have a lot of comments that explain them.
