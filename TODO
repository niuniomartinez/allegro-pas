  * ex_menu.pas(220,29) Warning: Converting pointers to signed integers may
    result in wrong comparison results and range errors, use an unsigned type
    instead. (Because AL_INTPTR_T).

  * Support for the latest Allegro release (this version is based in the
    5.2.0).

  * Check the "pointer types":  Where to use them.

  * Check how to detect GTK+ and do correct compilation in ex_menu.
    Also {$DEFINE} may be useful.  Problem is that I don't see "DEFINES"
    propagates correctly (FPC).  Ask about it.

  * At ALLEGRO_USER_EVENT, I think that data1..data4 should be in an UNION
    that defines them as AL_POINTER and also as AL_ULONG/AL_LONG.
    - The Free Pascal documentation tells about INTPR or something.

  * See the various TODO notes in unit Allegro5.pas.

  * Sometimes it doesn't load samples.
    - It doesn't load on Fedora 64bit, but does on Ubuntu 32bit.
    - Suspect it's a problem with the funcion in C, similar than the problem
      with 3D rendering on Allegro 4.

  * There are some "enum" types (sets). Be sure that they have the correct
    sice in bits & bytes.  Read FPC and Delphi documentation.

  * nihGUI may need some changes in API (i.e. what's public and what's not).
