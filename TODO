  * Configuration load in ex_draw.pas.

  * Check the "pointer types":  Where to use them.

  * Check how to detect GTK+ and do correct compilation in ex_menu.
    Also {$DEFINE} may be useful.  Problem is that I don't see "DEFINES"
    propagates correctly (FPC).  Ask about it.

  * See the various TODO notes in different units.

  * Sometimes it doesn't load samples.
    - It doesn't load on Fedora 64bit, but does on Ubuntu 32bit.
    - Suspect it's a problem with the funcion in C, similar than the problem
      with 3D rendering on Allegro 4.

  * There are some "enum" types (sets). Be sure that they have the correct
    sice in bits & bytes.  Read FPC and Delphi documentation.

  * ex_lines and ex_prim should use Thau instead of Pi.
