PROGRAM ex_inject_events;
(*
 * Ryan Roden-Corrent
 * Example that injects regular (non-user-type) allegro events into a queue.
 * This could be useful for 'faking' certain event sources.
 * For example, you could imitate joystick events without a * joystick.
 *
 * Based on the ex_user_events.c example.
