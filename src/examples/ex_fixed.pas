program ex_fixed;
(*
 *    Example program for the Allegro library, by Shawn Hargreaves.
 *
 *    This program demonstrates how to use fixed point numbers, which
 *    are signed 32-bit integers storing the integer part in the
 *    upper 16 bits and the decimal part in the 16 lower bits. This
 *    example also uses the unusual approach of communicating with
 *    the user exclusively via the allegro_message() function.
