(* Configuration for Delphi Comand-line Compiler (DCC).

  This file is included by library units to configure the compiler.  It isn't
  neccessary to include it in your projects.

  Note that this code was tested with Delphi Tokio 10.2 Starter Edition and
  Delphi Rio 10.3 Community Edition only.  I've tried Delphi 6 proffesional and
  IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL and I don't see how to make it run.  Theoretically it
  should work with Delphi 7 (as I've tried to keep Cieslak's changes) but I
  haven't a copy so it isn't tested.

  Also I've used a table from Embarcadero's Delphi Wiki.
