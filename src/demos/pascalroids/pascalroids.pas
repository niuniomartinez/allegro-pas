  PascalroidsGame: TPascalroids;

begin
  PascalroidsGame := TPascalroids.Create;
  try

See that the program can be rewritten as:

 program Pascalroids;
 uses Game;
 begin with TPascalroids.Create do try if Initialize then Run finally Free end end.

I was tempted to use that, as I find it elegant and also it needs less memory (8
octects in 64bit computers) but it is also a bit arrogant and it may send the
erroneous message that use `with` is good (and it isn't!).

BTW, didn't you notice that this unit has 4 semicolons, and that using `with` it
needs ONLY TWO?!?!  Semicolons are mandatory only to separate sentences in the
same ''level''.  That's why you can't put a semicolon before an `else`.

Also notice that this text isn't a { comment } but both Delphi and Free Pascal
won't return any compillation error.

Boy, I really love this language!
