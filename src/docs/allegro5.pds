#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_USER_MAIN
Description of user main function for @link(al_run_main).

#Allegro5.al_get_allegro_version
Returns the compiled version of the Allegro library @(i.e. the dll/so/dylib
file@), packed into a single integer as groups of 8 bits.

You can use code like this to extract the version number:
@longcode(!
VAR
  Version: LONGINT;
  Major, Minor, Revision, Release: INTEGER;
  VersionStr: STRING;
BEGIN
  Version := al_get_allegro_version;
  Major    :=  Version SHR 24;
  Minor    := (Version SHR 16) AND 255;
  Revision := (Version SHR  8) AND 255;
  Release  :=  Version         AND 255;
  VersionStr := Format ('%d.%d.%d[%d]', [Major, Minor, Revision, Release])
END;
!)
The release number is 0 for an unofficial version and 1 or greater for an
official release. For example "5.0.2[1]" would be the (first) official 5.0.2
release while "5.0.2[0]" would be a compile of a version from the "5.0.2"
branch before the official release.

Remember this version number isn't for Allegro.pas but for Allegro.  In most cases will @bold(not) be the same than @link(ALLEGRO_VERSION_INT).

#Allegro5.al_run_main
This function is useful in cases where you don't have a @code(main) function
but want to run Allegro (mostly useful in a wrapper library).  Under Windows
and Linux this is no problem because you simply can call
@link(al_install_system).  But some other system (like OSX) don't allow calling
@code(al_install_system) in the main thread.  @code(al_run_main) will know what
to do in that case.

The passed @code(argc) and @code(argv) will simply be passed on to
@code(user_main) and the return value of @code(user_main) will be returned.

@bold(Note)

This is used because the way the C language works.  I didn't test
if Pascal do need this kind of stuff.  Future versions of Allegro.pas would not
include this function, so don't use it unless your really need to (and tell me
if you really need it to remove this warning from documentation).

This is the full circle, which is more convenient in most cases.  For more information read @html(<a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto">The Tau manifesto</a>).

#Allegro5.AL_ID
This function can be used to create a packed 32 bit integer from 8 bit
characters, on both 32 and 64 bit machines.  These can be used for various
 things, like custom datafile objects or system IDs. Example:
@longcode(!
VAR
  OSTYPE_LINUX: LONGINT;
BEGIN
  OSTYPE_LINUX := AL_ID('TUX ');
END;

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_TIMEOUT
Represents a timeout value.

The size of the structure is known so it can be statically allocated.  The
contents are private. @seealso(al_init_timeout)

#Allegro5.al_get_time
Returns the number of seconds since the Allegro library was initialised.
The return value is undefined if Allegro is uninitialised. The resolution
depends on the used driver, but typically can be in the order of microseconds.
@seealso(al_rest)

#Allegro5.al_rest
Waits for the specified number of seconds. This tells the system to pause the

accuracy can be in the order of 10ms. That is, even @code(al_rest @(0.000001@))
might pause for something like 10ms. Also see the other timer rutines (i.e.
@link(al_create_timer)) for easier ways to time your program without using up
all CPU.

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_COLOR
An @code(ALLEGRO_COLOR) structure describes a color in a device independent
way.  Use @link(al_map_rgb) et al. and @link(al_unmap_rgb) et al. to translate
from and to various color representations.

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT
Pixel formats. Each pixel format specifies the exact size and bit layout of a
pixel in memory. Components are specified from high bits to low bits, so for
example a fully opaque red pixel in @code(ARGB_8888) format is @code($FFFF0000).

@bold(Note)

  The pixel format is independent of endianness. That is, in the above example
  you can always get the red component with @code(@(pixel AND $00ff0000@) SHR
  16). But you can not rely on this code:  @code(@(pixel + 2@)^) it will return
  the red component on little endian systems, but the green component on big
  endian systems.

Also note that Allegro's naming is different from OpenGL naming here, where a
format of @code(GL_RGBA8) merely defines the component order and the exact
layout including endianness treatment is specified separately. Usually
@code(GL_RGBA8) will correspond to @code(ALLEGRO_PIXEL_ABGR_8888) though on
little endian systems, so care must be taken (note the reversal of
RGBA <-> ABGR).

The only exception to this @code(ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_ABGR_8888_LE) which will
always have the components as 4 bytes corresponding to red, green, blue and
alpha, in this order, independent of the endianness.

Some of the pixel formats represent compressed bitmap formats. Compressed bitmaps take up less space in the GPU memory than bitmaps with regular (uncompressed) pixel formats. This smaller footprint means that you can load more resources into GPU memory, and they will be drawn somewhat faster. The compression is lossy, however, so it is not appropriate for all graphical styles: it tends to work best for images with smooth color gradations. It is possible to compress bitmaps at runtime by passing the appropriate bitmap format in @link(al_set_new_bitmap_format) and then creating, loading, cloning or converting a non-compressed bitmap. This, however, is not recommended as the compression quality differs between different GPU drivers. It is recommended to compress these bitmaps ahead of time using external tools and then load them compressed.

Unlike regular pixel formats, compressed pixel formats are not laid out in memory one pixel row at a time. Instead, the bitmap is subdivided into rectangular blocks of pixels that are then laid out in block rows. This means that regular locking functions cannot use compressed pixel formats as the destination format. Instead, you can use the blocked versions of the bitmap locking functions which do support these formats.

It is not recommended to use compressed bitmaps as target bitmaps, as that operation cannot be hardware accelerated. Due to proprietary algorithms used, it is typically impossible to create compressed memory bitmaps.
@seealso(al_set_new_bitmap_format) @seealso(al_get_bitmap_format)
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_ANY
Let the driver choose a format. This is the default format at program start.
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_ABGR_8888_LE
Like the version without _LE, but the component order is guaranteed to
be red, green, blue, alpha. This only makes a difference on big endian
systems, on little endian it is just an alias.
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_SINGLE_CHANNEL_8
A single 8-bit channel. A pixel value maps onto the red channel when
displayed, but it is undefined how it maps onto green, blue and alpha
channels. When drawing to bitmaps of this format, only the red channel
is taken into account. Allegro may have to use fallback methods to
render to bitmaps of this format. This pixel format is mainly intended
for storing the color indices of an indexed (paletted) image, usually in
conjunction with a pixel shader that maps indices to RGBA values.
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_COMPRESSED_RGBA_DXT1
Compressed using the DXT1 compression algorithm. Each 4x4 pixel block
is encoded in 64 bytes, resulting in 6-8x compression ratio. Only a
single bit of alpha per pixel is supported.
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_COMPRESSED_RGBA_DXT3
Compressed using the DXT3 compression algorithm. Each 4x4 pixel block
is encoded in 128 bytes, resulting in 4x compression ratio. This format
supports sharp alpha transitions.
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_COMPRESSED_RGBA_DXT5

#Allegro5.al_premul_rgba
This is a shortcut for @code(al_map_rgba @(r * a / 255, g * a / 255, b * a / 255, a@)).

By default Allegro uses pre-multiplied alpha for transparent blending of
bitmaps and primitives (see @link(al_load_bitmap_flags) for a discussion of
that feature). This means that if you want to tint a bitmap or primitive to be
transparent you need to multiply the color components by the alpha components
when you pass them to this function. For example:
@longcode(!
VAR
  c: ALLEGRO_COLOR;
  bmp: ALLEGRO_BITMAPptr;
BEGIN
  c := al_premul_rgba (255, 0, 0, 127);

  @item(Creates a bitmap residing in system memory. Operations on, and with, memory bitmaps will not be hardware accelerated. However, direct pixel access can be relatively quick compared to video bitmaps, which depend on the display driver in use.

    @italic(Note:) Allegro's software rendering routines are currently somewhat unoptimised.

    @italic(Note:) Combining @code(ALLEGRO_VIDEO_BITMAP) with @code(ALLEGRO_MEMORY_BITMAP) flags is invalid.)
  @itemlabel(ALLEGRO_VIDEO_BITMAP)
  @item(Creates a bitmap that resides in the video card memory. These types of bitmaps receive the greatest benefit from hardware acceleration.

    @italic(Note:) Creating a video bitmap will fail if there is no current display or the current display driver cannot create the bitmap. The latter will happen if for example the format or dimensions are not supported.

    @italic(Note:) Bitmaps created with this flag will be converted to memory bitmaps when the last display is destroyed. In most cases it is therefore easier to use the @code(ALLEGRO_CONVERT_BITMAP) flag instead.

    @italic(Note:) Combining @code(ALLEGRO_VIDEO_BITMAP) with @code(ALLEGRO_MEMORY_BITMAP) flags is invalid.)
  @itemlabel(ALLEGRO_CONVERT_BITMAP)
  @item(This is the default. It will try to create a video bitmap and if that fails create a memory bitmap. Bitmaps created with this flag when there is no active display will be converted to video bitmaps next time a display is created. They also will remain video bitmaps if the last display is destroyed and then another is created again.

    @italic(Note:) You can combine this flag with @code(ALLEGRO_MEMORY_BITMAP) or @code(ALLEGRO_VIDEO_BITMAP) to force the initial type (and fail in the latter case if no video bitmap can be created) - but usually neither of those combinations is very useful.

    You can use the display option @code(ALLEGRO_AUTO_CONVERT_BITMAPS) to control which displays will try to auto-convert bitmaps.)
  @itemlabel(ALLEGRO_NO_PRESERVE_TEXTURE)
  @item(Normally, every effort is taken to preserve the contents of bitmaps, since some platforms may forget them. This can take extra processing time. If you know it doesn't matter if a bitmap keeps its pixel data, for example when it's a temporary buffer, use this flag to tell Allegro not to attempt to preserve its contents.)
  @itemlabel(ALLEGRO_ALPHA_TEST)
  @item(This is a driver hint only. It tells the graphics driver to do alpha testing instead of alpha blending on bitmaps created with this flag. Alpha testing is usually faster and preferred if your bitmaps have only one level of alpha (0). This flag is currently not widely implemented @(i.e., only for memory bitmaps@).)
  @itemlabel(ALLEGRO_MIN_LINEAR)
  @item(When drawing a scaled down version of the bitmap, use linear filtering. This usually looks better. You can also combine it with the @code(ALLEGRO_MIPMAP) flag for even better quality.)
  @itemlabel(ALLEGRO_MAG_LINEAR)
  @item(When drawing a magnified version of a bitmap, use linear filtering. This will cause the picture to get blurry instead of creating a big rectangle for each pixel. It depends on how you want things to look like whether you want to use this or not.)
  @itemlabel(ALLEGRO_MIPMAP)
  @item(This can only be used for bitmaps whose width and height is a power of two. In that case, it will generate mipmaps and use them when drawing scaled down versions. For example if the bitmap is 64x64, then extra bitmaps of sizes 32x32, 16x16, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1 will be created always containing a scaled down version of the original.)

#Allegro5.al_create_bitmap
Creates a new bitmap using the bitmap format and flags for the current
thread. Blitting between bitmaps of differing formats, or blitting between
memory bitmaps and display bitmaps may be slow.

Unless you set the @code(ALLEGRO_MEMORY_BITMAP) flag, the bitmap is created for the
current display.  Blitting to another display may be slow.

If a display bitmap is created, there may be limitations on the allowed
dimensions. For example a DirectX or OpenGL backend usually has a maximum
allowed texture size - so if bitmap creation fails for very large
dimensions, you may want to re-try with a smaller bitmap. Some platforms
also dictate a minimum texture size, which is relevant if you plan to use
this bitmap with the primitives addon. If you try to create a bitmap smaller
than this, this call will not fail but the returned bitmap will be a section
of a larger bitmap with the minimum size. The minimun size that will work on all platforms is 32 by 32.

Some platforms do not directly support display bitmaps whose dimensions are
not powers of two. Allegro handles this by creating a larger bitmap that has
dimensions that are powers of two and then returning a section of that
bitmap with the dimensions you requested. This can be relevant if you plan
to use this bitmap with the primitives addon but shouldn't be an issue
otherwise.

If you create a bitmap without @code(ALLEGRO_MEMORY_BITMAP) set but there is no current display, a temporary memory bitmap will be created instead. You can later convert all such bitmap to video bitmap and assign to a display by calling @link(al_convert_memory_bitmaps).

On some platforms the contents of video bitmaps may be lost when your application loses focus. Allegro has an internal mechanism to restore the contents of these video bitmaps, but it is not foolproof (sometimes bitmap contents can get lost permanently) and has performance implications. If you are using a bitmap as an intermediate buffer this mechanism may be wasteful. In this case, if you do not want Allegro to manage the bitmap contents for you, you can disable this mechanism by creating the bitmap with the @code(ALLEGRO_NO_PRESERVE_TEXTURE) flag. The bitmap contents are lost when you get the @code(ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_LOST) and @code(ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_HALT_DRAWING) and a should be restored when you get the @code(ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_FOUND) and when you call @link(al_acknowledge_drawing_resume) (after @code(ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_RESUME_DRAWING) event). You can use those events to implement your own bitmap content restoration mechanism if Allegro's does not work well enough for you (for example, you can reload them all from disk).

@italic(Note:) The contents of a newly created bitmap are undefined - you need to clear the bitmap or make sure all pixels get overwritten before drawing it.

When you are done with using the bitmap you must call @link(al_destroy_bitmap) on it to free any resources allocated for it.

#Allegro5.al_create_sub_bitmap
Creates a sub-bitmap of the parent, at the specified coordinates and of the
specified size. A sub-bitmap is a bitmap that shares drawing memory with a
pre-existing (parent) bitmap, but possibly with a different size and clipping
settings.

The sub-bitmap may originate off or extend past the parent bitmap.

See the discussion in @link(al_get_backbuffer) about using sub-bitmaps of the
backbuffer.

The parent bitmap's clipping rectangles are ignored.

If a sub-bitmap was not or cannot be created then @nil is returned.

When you are done with using the sub-bitmap you must call
@link(al_destroy_bitmap) on it to free any resources allocated for it.

Note that destroying parents of sub-bitmaps will not destroy the sub-bitmaps;
instead the sub-bitmaps become invalid and should no longer be used for
drawing - they still must be destroyed with @code(al_destroy_bitmap) however.  It
does not matter whether you destroy a sub-bitmap before or after its parent
otherwise.
@seealso(al_create_bitmap) @seealso(al_is_sub_bitmap) @seealso(al_get_parent_bitmap)

#Allegro5.al_get_parent_bitmap
Returns the bitmap this bitmap is a sub-bitmap of. Returns @nil if this
bitmap is not a sub-bitmap. This function always returns the real bitmap,
and never a sub-bitmap. This might NOT match what was passed to
@code(al_create_sub_bitmap). Consider this code, for instance:
@longcode(!
VAR
  a, b, c: ALLEGRO_BITMAPptr;
BEGIN
  a := al_create_bitmap (512, 512);
  b := al_create_sub_bitmap (a, 128, 128, 256, 256);
  c := al_create_sub_bitmap (b, 64, 64, 128, 128);
  IF (al_get_parent_bitmap (b) = a) AND (al_get_parent_bitmap (c) = a) THEN
    WriteLn ('b & c are sub-bitmaps of a')
END;
!)
The message will be printed because only @code(a) is a real bitmap, and both @code(b) and @code(c)
are its sub-bitmaps.

#Allegro5.al_reparent_bitmap
For a sub-bitmap, changes the parent, position and size.  This is the same as
destroying the bitmap and re-creating it with @code(al_create_sub_bitmap) -
except the bitmap pointer stays the same.  This has many uses, for example an
animation player could return a single bitmap which can just be re-parented to
different animation frames without having to re-draw the contents.  Or a sprite
atlas could re-arrange its sprites without having to invalidate all existing
bitmaps. @seealso(al_create_sub_bitmap) @seealso(al_get_parent_bitmap)

#Allegro5.al_clone_bitmap
Creates a new bitmap with @code(al_create_bitmap), and copyes the pixel data from
the old bitmap across.  The newly created bitmap will be created with the current new bitmap flags, and not the ones that were used to create the original bitmap.  If the new bitmap is a memory bitmap, its projection
bitmap is reset to be orthographic.

#Allegro5.al_convert_bitmap
Converts the bitmap to the current bitmap flags and format.  The bitmap will
be as if it was created new with @code(al_create_bitmap) but retain its
contents.  All of this bitmap's sub-bitmaps are also converted.  If the new
bitmap type is memory, then the bitmap's projection bitmap is reset to be
orthographic.

If this bitmap is a sub-bitmap, then it, its parent and all the sibling
sub-bitmaps are also converted.

#Allegro5.al_convert_memory_bitmaps
If you create a bitmap when there is no current display (for example because
you have not called @link(al_create_display) in the current thread) and are
using the @code(ALLEGRO_CONVERT_BITMAP) bitmap flag (which is set by default)
then the bitmap will be created successfully, but as a memory bitmap.  This
function converts all such bitmaps to proper video bitmaps belonging to the
current display.

Note that video bitmaps get automatically converted back to memory bitmaps
when the last display is destroyed.

This operation will preserve all bitmap flags except
@code(ALLEGRO_VIDEO_BITMAP) and @code(ALLEGRO_MEMORY_BITMAP).

#Allegro5.al_draw_bitmap
Draws an unscaled, unrotated bitmap at the given position to the current
target bitmap.  @code(flags) can be a combination of:
@unorderedlist(
  @item(@code(ALLEGRO_FLIP_HORIZONTAL) - flip the bitmap about the y-axis)
  @item(@code(ALLEGRO_FLIP_VERTICAL) - flip the bitmap about the x-axis)
)
@bold(Note)

The current target bitmap must be a different bitmap. Drawing a
bitmap to itself (or to a sub-bitmap of itself) or drawing a sub-bitmap to
its parent (or another sub-bitmap of its parent) are not currently
supported. To copy part of a bitmap into the same bitmap simply use a
temporary bitmap instead.

@bold(Note)

The backbuffer (or a sub-bitmap thereof) can not be
transformed, blended or tinted. If you need to draw the backbuffer draw it
to a temporary bitmap first with no active transformation (except
translation). Blending and tinting settings/parameters will be ignored. This
does not apply when drawing into a memory bitmap.

The point at @code(cx/cy) relative to the upper left corner of the bitmap will be drawn at @code(dx/dy) and the bitmap is rotated around this point. If @code(cx,cy) is @code(0,0) the bitmap will rotate around its upper left corner.

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_FILEptr
An opaque object representing an open file. This could be a real file on disk or a virtual file.

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_FILE_INTERFACE
A structure containing function pointers to handle a type of "file", real
or virtual. See the full discussion in @link(al_set_new_file_interface).

The @code(fi_open) function must allocate memory for whatever userdata
structure it needs.  The pointer to that memory must be returned; it will
then be associated with the file. The other functions can access that data
by calling @link(al_get_file_userdata) on the file handle. If
@code(fi_open) returns @nil then @link(al_fopen) will also return @nil.

The @code(fi_fclose) function must clean up and free the userdata, but
Allegro will free the @code(ALLEGRO_FILEptr) handle.

If @code(fi_fungetc) is @nil, then Allegro's default implementation of a
16 char long buffer will be used.
@seealso(al_set_new_file_interface) @seealso(al_fopen_interface)
@seealso(al_get_file_userdata)
#Allegro5.al_fopen
Creates and opens a file (real or virtual) given the path and mode. The
current file interface is used to open the file.

Depending on the stream type and the mode string, files may be opened in
"text" mode. The handling of newlines is particularly important. For
example, using the default stdio-based streams on DOS and Windows
platforms, where the native end-of-line terminators are @code(CR+LF)
sequences, a call to @link(al_fgetc) may return just one character ('\n')
where there were two bytes (@code(CR+LF)) in the file. When writing out
'\n', two bytes would be written instead. (As an aside, '\n' is not
defined to be equal to @code(LF) either.)

Newline translations can be useful for text files but is disastrous for
binary files. To avoid this behaviour you need to open file streams in
binary mode by using a mode argument containing a "b", e.g. @code('rb'), @code('wb).

The standard I/O backend also clears the end-of-file indicator, and other

it if you need your code to be portable to other backends.

#Allegro5.al_fungetc
Ungets a single byte from a file. Pushed-back bytes are not written to the
file, only made available for subsequent reads, in reverse order.

The number of pushbacks depends on the backend. The standard I/O backend
only guarantees a single pushback; this depends on the libc implementation.

For backends that follow the standard behavior, the pushback buffer will
be cleared after any seeking or writing; also calls to @link(al_fseek) and
@link(al_ftell) are relative to the number of pushbacks. If a pushback
causes the position to become negative, the behavior of @code(al_fseek)
and @code(al_ftell) are undefined.

#Allegro5.al_fopen_slice
Opens a slice (subset) of an already open random access file as if it were

not be used in any way.

The slice is opened at the current location of the parent file, up through
@code(initial_size) bytes. The @code(initial_size) may be any non-negative
integer that will not exceed the bounds of the parent file.

Seeking with @code(ALLEGRO_SEEK_SET) will be relative to this starting location.
@code(ALLEGRO_SEEK_END) will be relative to the starting location plus the size
of the slice.

The mode can be any combination of:@unorderedlist(
@item(r: read access)  @item(w: write access) @item(e: expandable)
)

For example, a mode of @code('rw') indicates the file can be read and
written. (Note that this is slightly different from the stdio modes.) Keep
in mind that the parent file must support random access and be open in
normal write mode (not append) for the slice to work in a well defined way.

If the slice is marked as expandable, then reads and writes can happen
after the initial end point, and the slice will grow accordingly.
Otherwise, all activity is restricted to the initial size of the slice.

A slice must be closed with @link(al_fclose). The parent file will then be
positioned immediately after the end of the slice.

Loads an image file into a new @code(ALLEGRO_BITMAPptr). The file type is
determined by the extension, except if the file has no extension in which
case @link(al_identify_bitmap) is used instead.

@code(Note:) the core Allegro library does not support any image file
formats by default. You must use the @link(al5image) addon, or register your
own format handler.
@param(filename The file to load.)
@param(flags It may be a combination of the following constants:
@unorderedlist(
   @item(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_NO_PREMULTIPLIED_ALPHA))
    By default, Allegro pre-multiplies the alpha channel of an image with the
    images color data when it loads it. Typically that would look something like
    this:
@longcode(!
  r := get_float_byte;
  g := get_float_byte;
  b := get_float_byte;
  a := get_float_byte;

  r := r * a;
  g := g * a;
  b := b * a;

  set_image_pixel (x, y, r, g, b, a);
!)
    The reason for this can be seen in the Allegro example @code(ex_premulalpha),
    ie, using pre-multiplied alpha gives more accurate color results in some
    cases. To use alpha blending with images loaded with pre-multiplied alpha,
    you would use the default blending mode, which is set with
    @code(al_set_blender @(ALLEGRO_ADD, ALLEGRO_ONE, ALLEGRO_INVERSE_ALPHA@)).

    The @code(ALLEGRO_NO_PREMULTIPLIED_ALPHA) flag being set will ensure that
    images are not loaded with alpha pre-multiplied, but are loaded with color
    values direct from the image. That looks like this:
@longcode(!
  r := get_float_byte;
  g := get_float_byte;
  b := get_float_byte;
  a := get_float_byte;

  set_image_pixel (x, y, r, g, b, a);
!)
    To draw such an image using regular alpha blending, you would use
    @code(al_set_blender @(ALLEGRO_ADD, ALLEGRO_ALPHA, ALLEGRO_INVERSE_ALPHA@))
    to set the correct blender. This has some caveats. First, as mentioned
    above, drawing such an image can result in less accurate color blending
    (when drawing an image with linear filtering on, the edges will be darker
    than they should be). Second, the behaviour is somewhat confusing, which is
    explained in the example below.
@longcode(!
{ Load and create bitmaps with an alpha channel. }
  al_set_new_bitmap_format (ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_ANY_32_WITH_ALPHA);
{ Load some bitmap with alpha in it. }
  bmp := al_load_bitmap ('some_alpha_bitmap.png');
{ We will draw to this buffer and then draw this buffer to the screen. }
  tmp_buffer := al_create_bitmap (SCREEN_W, SCREEN_H);
{ Set the buffer as the target and clear it. }
  al_set_target_bitmap (tmp_buffer);
  al_clear_to_color (al_map_rgba_f (0, 0, 0, 1));
{ Draw the bitmap to the temporary buffer. }
  al_draw_bitmap (bmp, 0, 0, 0);
{ Finally, draw the buffer to the screen.
  The output will look incorrect (may take close inspection
  depending on the bitmap -- it may also be very obvious). }
  al_set_target_bitmap (al_get_backbuffer (display));
  al_draw_bitmap (tmp_buffer, 0, 0, 0);
!)
    To explain further, if you have a pixel with 0.5 alpha, and you're using
    @code(@(ALLEGRO_ADD, ALLEGRO_ALPHA, ALLEGRO_INVERSE_ALPHA@)) for blending,
    the formula is:
@preformatted(
  a := da * dst + sa * src
)
    Expands to:
@longcode(!
  result_a := dst_a * (1-0.5) + 0.5 * 0.5
!)
    So if you draw the image to the temporary buffer, it is blended once
    resulting in 0.75 alpha, then drawn again to the screen, blended in the
    same way, resulting in a pixel has 0.1875 as an alpha value.)

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_LOCKED_REGION
Users who wish to manually edit or read from a bitmap are required to lock
it first.  The @code(ALLEGRO_LOCKED_REGION) structure represents the
locked region of the bitmap.  This call will work with any bitmap,
including memory bitmaps.
@seealso(al_lock_bitmap) @seealso(al_lock_bitmap_region)
@seealso(al_unlock_bitmap) @seealso(ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT)
@member data Points to the leftmost pixel of the first row (row 0) of the locked region.
@member format Indicates the pixel format of the data.
@member pitch Gives the size in bytes of a single row (also known as the stride).  The pitch may be greater than @code(width * pixel_size) due to padding; this is not uncommon.  It is also not uncommon for the pitch to be negative (the bitmap may be upside down).  For blocked bitmaps, 'row' refers to the row of blocks, not of pixels.
@member pixel_size It is the number of bytes used to represent a single block of pixels for the pixel format of this locked region. For most formats (and historically, this used to be true for all formats), this is just the size of a single pixel, but for blocked pixel formats this value is different.

#Allegro5.al_lock_bitmap
Locks an entire bitmap for reading or writing. If the bitmap is a display
bitmap it will be updated from system memory after the bitmap is unlocked
(unless locked read only).

On some platforms, Allegro automatically backs up the contents of video bitmaps because they may be occasionally lost (see discussion in @link(al_create_bitmap)'s documentation). If you're completely recreating the bitmap contents often (e.g. every frame) then you will get much better performance by creating the target bitmap with @code(ALLEGRO_NO_PRESERVE_TEXTURE) flag.

@bold(Note)

While a bitmap is locked, you can not use any drawing
operations on it (with the sole exception of @link(al_put_pixel) and
@link(al_put_blended_pixel)).
@param(flags @unorderedlist(
  @item(@code(ALLEGRO_LOCK_READONLY) The locked region will not be written
    to. This can be faster if the bitmap is a video texture, as it can be
    discarded after the lock instead of uploaded back to the card.)
  @item(@code(ALLEGRO_LOCK_WRITEONLY) The locked region will not be read
    from. This can be faster if the bitmap is a video texture, as no data
    need to be read from the video card. You are required to fill in all
    pixels before unlocking the bitmap again, so be careful when using this
    flag.)
  @item(@code(ALLEGRO_LOCK_READWRITE) The locked region can be written to
    and read from. Use this flag if a partial number of pixels need to be
    written to, even if reading is not needed.)
))
@param(format Indicates the pixel format that the returned buffer will be
  in. To lock in the same format as the bitmap stores its data internally,
  call with @code(al_get_bitmap_format @(bitmap@)) as the format or use
  @code(ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_ANY). Locking in the native format will
  usually be faster. If the bitmap format is compressed, using
  @code(ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_ANY) will choose an implementation defined
  non-compressed format.)
@Return(@nil if the bitmap cannot be locked, e.g. the bitmap was locked previously and not unlocked. It also returns @nil if the format is a compressed format.)

#Allegro5.al_lock_bitmap_region
Like @link(al_lock_bitmap), but only locks a specific area of the bitmap. If
the bitmap is a video bitmap, only that area of the texture will be updated
when it is unlocked. Locking only the region you indend to modify will be
faster than locking the whole bitmap.

@bold(Note)

Using the @code(ALLEGRO_LOCK_WRITEONLY) with a blocked pixel
format (i.e. formats for which @link(al_get_pixel_block_width) or
@link(al_get_pixel_block_height) do not return 1) requires you to have the
region be aligned to the block width for optimal performance. If it is not,
then the function will have to lock the region with the
@code(ALLEGRO_LOCK_READWRITE) instead in order to pad this region with
valid data.
@seealso(ALLEGRO_LOCKED_REGION) @seealso(ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT)
@seealso(al_unlock_bitmap)
#Allegro5.al_lock_bitmap_blocked
Like @link(al_lock_bitmap), but allows locking bitmaps with a blocked pixel
format (i.e. a format for which @link(al_get_pixel_block_width) or
@link(al_get_pixel_block_height) do not return 1) in that format. To that
end, this function also does not allow format conversion. For bitmap formats
with a block size of 1, this function is identical to calling
@code(al_lock_bitmap @(bmp, al_get_bitmap_format @(bmp@), flags@)).

@bold(Note)

Currently there are no drawing functions that work when the
bitmap is locked with a compressed format. @link(al_get_pixel) will also not
work.

#Allegro5.al_set_blender
Sets the function to use for blending for the current thread.

Blending means, the source and destination colors are combined in drawing
operations.

Assume the source color (e.g. color of a rectangle to draw, or pixel of a
bitmap to draw) is given as its red/green/blue/alpha components (if the
bitmap has no alpha it always is assumed to be fully opaque, so 255 for
8-bit or 1.0 for floating point): @italic(s = s.r, s.g, s.b, s.a). And this
color is drawn to a destination, which already has a color:
@italic(d = d.r, d.g, d.b, d.a).

The conceptional formula used by Allegro to draw any pixel then depends on
the @code(op) parameter:
@unorderedlist(
@item(@code(ALLEGRO_ADD)
@preformatted(
  r = d.r * df.r + s.r * sf.r
  g = d.g * df.g + s.g * sf.g
  b = d.b * df.b + s.b * sf.b
  a = d.a * df.a + s.a * sf.a
))
@item(@code(ALLEGRO_DEST_MINUS_SRC)
@preformatted(
  r = d.r * df.r - s.r * sf.r
  g = d.g * df.g - s.g * sf.g
  b = d.b * df.b - s.b * sf.b
  a = d.a * df.a - s.a * sf.a
))
@item(@code(ALLEGRO_SRC_MINUS_DEST)
@preformatted(
  r = s.r * sf.r - d.r * df.r
  g = s.g * sf.g - d.g * df.g
  b = s.b * sf.b - d.b * df.b
  a = s.a * sf.a - d.a * df.a
))
)
Valid values for the factors @italic(sf) and @italic(df) passed to this
function are as follows, where @italic(s) is the source color, @italic(d)
the destination color and @italic(cc) the color set with
@link(al_set_blend_color) (white by default)
@unorderedlist(
  @item(@bold(ALLEGRO_ZERO) @code(f = 0, 0, 0, 0))
  @item(@bold(ALLEGRO_ONE) @code(f = 1, 1, 1, 1))
  @item(@bold(ALLEGRO_ALPHA) @code(f = s.a, s.a, s.a, s.a))
  @item(@bold(ALLEGRO_INVERSE_ALPHA) @code(f = 1 - s.a, 1 - s.a, 1 - s.a, 1 - s.a))
  @item(@bold(ALLEGRO_SRC_COLOR) @code(f = s.r, s.g, s.b, s.a))
  @item(@bold(ALLEGRO_DEST_COLOR) @code(f = d.r, d.g, d.b, d.a))
  @item(@bold(ALLEGRO_INVERSE_SRC_COLOR) @code(f = 1 - s.r, 1 - s.g, 1 - s.b, 1 - s.a))
  @item(@bold(ALLEGRO_INVERSE_DEST_COLOR) @code(f = 1 - d.r, 1 - d.g, 1 - d.b, 1 - d.a))
  @item(@bold(ALLEGRO_CONST_COLOR) @code(f = cc.r, cc.g, cc.b, cc.a))
  @item(@bold(ALLEGRO_INVERSE_CONST_COLOR) @code(f = 1 - cc.r, 1 - cc.g, 1 - cc.b, 1 - cc.a))
)
So for example, to restore the default of using premultiplied alpha
blending, you would use:
@longcode(!
al_set_blender (ALLEGRO_ADD, ALLEGRO_ONE, ALLEGRO_INVERSE_ALPHA);
!)
As formula:
@preformatted(
  r = d.r * (1 - s.a) + s.r * 1
  g = d.g * (1 - s.a) + s.g * 1
  b = d.b * (1 - s.a) + s.b * 1
  a = d.a * (1 - s.a) + s.a * 1
)
If you are using non-pre-multiplied alpha, you could use
@longcode(!
al_set_blender(ALLEGRO_ADD, ALLEGRO_ALPHA, ALLEGRO_INVERSE_ALPHA);
!)
Additive blending would be achieved with
@longcode(!
al_set_blender(ALLEGRO_ADD, ALLEGRO_ONE, ALLEGRO_ONE);
!)
Copying the source to the destination (including alpha) unmodified
@longcode(!
al_set_blender(ALLEGRO_ADD, ALLEGRO_ONE, ALLEGRO_ZERO);

@longcode(!
al_set_blender(ALLEGRO_ADD, ALLEGRO_DEST_COLOR, ALLEGRO_ZERO)

al_set_blender(ALLEGRO_ADD, ALLEGRO_CONST_COLOR, ALLEGRO_ONE);
al_set_blend_color(al_map_rgb(0, 96, 255)); { nice Chrysler blue }
!)
Averaging source and destination pixels
@longcode(!
al_set_blender(ALLEGRO_ADD, ALLEGRO_CONST_COLOR, ALLEGRO_CONST_COLOR);
al_set_blend_color(al_map_rgba_f(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5));
!)
As formula:
@preformatted(
  r = d.r * 0 + s.r * d.r
  g = d.g * 0 + s.g * d.g
  b = d.b * 0 + s.b * d.b

@item(@bold(@code(keyboard.modifiers))
    This is a bitfield of the modifier keys which were pressed when the event occurred. See @html(<a href="introduction.html#kbdmodifiers">"Keyboard modifier flags"</a>) for the constants.)
@item(@bold(@code(keyboard.frepeat))
    Indicates if this is a repeated character.)
@item(@bold(@code(keyboard.display))
    The display which had keyboard focus when the event occurred.)
)

@bold(Note)

in many input methods, characters are not entered one-for-one with physical key presses. Multiple key presses can combine to generate a single character, e.g. apostrophe + e may produce 'é'. Fewer key presses can also generate more characters, e.g. macro sequences expanding to common phrases.

@bold(Note)

Calling @link(al_set_mouse_xy) also will result in a change of axis values, but such a change is reported with @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_MOUSE_WARPED) events instead which are identical except for their type.

@bold(Note)

currently mouse.display may be @nil if an event is generated in response to @link(al_set_mouse_axis).

@item(@bold(@code(display.height))
    The new height of the display.)
)
You should normally respond to these events by calling @link(al_acknowledge_resize). Note that further resize events may be generated by the time you process the event, so these fields may hold outdated information.
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_CLOSE
The close button of the window has been pressed.
@unorderedlist(
@item(@bold(@code(display.source))
    The display which was closed.)
)
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_LOST
When using Direct3D, displays can enter a "lost" state. In that state, drawing calls are ignored, and upon entering the state, bitmap's pixel data can become undefined. Allegro does its best to preserve the correct contents of bitmaps (see the @code(ALLEGRO_NO_PRESERVE_TEXTURE) flag at @link(al_set_new_bitmap_flags)) and restore them when the device is "found" (see @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_FOUND)). However, this is not 100% fool proof (see discussion in @link(al_create_bitmap)'s documentation).

@bold(Note)

This event merely means that the display was lost, that is, DirectX suddenly lost the contents of all video bitmaps. In particular, you can keep calling drawing functions -- they just most likely won't do anything. If Allegro's restoration of the bitmaps works well for you then no further action is required when you receive this event.
@definitionlist(
  @itemlabel(@bold(@code(display.source))) @item(The display which was lost.)

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_FOUND
Generated when a lost device is restored to operating state.
@unorderedlist(

@seealso(ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_LOST)
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_SWITCH_IN
The window is the active one again.
@unorderedlist(
@item(@bold(@code(display.source))
    The display which was switched into.)
)
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_SWITCH_OUT
The window is no longer active, that is the user might have clicked into another window or "tabbed" away. In response to this event you might want to call @link(al_clear_keyboard_state) (possibly passing @code(display.source) as its argument) in order to prevent Allegro's keyboard state from getting out of sync.
@unorderedlist(
@item(@bold(@code(display.source))
    The display which was switched out of.)
)
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_ORIENTATION
Generated when the rotation or orientation of a display changes.
@unorderedlist(
@item(@bold(@code(display.source))
    The display which generated the event.)
@item(@bold(@code(event.display.orientation))
    Contains one of the following values:@unorderedlist(

        @item(@code(ALLEGRO_DISPLAY_ORIENTATION_FACE_DOWN))
    ))
)
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_HALT_DRAWING
When a display receives this event it should stop doing any drawing and then call @link(al_acknowledge_drawing_halt) immediately.

This is currently only relevant for Android and iOS. It will be sent when the application is switched to background mode, in addition to @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_SWITCH_OUT). The latter may also be sent in situations where the application is not active but still should continue drawing, for example when a popup is displayed in front of it.

@bold(Note)

This event means that the next time you call a drawing function, your program will crash. So you must stop drawing and you must immediately reply with @code(al_acknowledge_drawing_halt). Allegro sends this event because it cannot handle this automatically. Your program might be doing the drawing in a different thread from the event handling, in which case the drawing thread needs to be signaled to stop drawing before acknowledging this event.

@bold(Note)

Mobile devices usually never quit an application, so to prevent the battery from draining while your application is halted it can be a good idea to call @link(al_stop_timer) on all your timers, otherwise they will keep generating events. If you are using audio, you can also stop all audio voices (or pass @nil to @link(al_set_default_voice) if you use the default mixer), otherwise Allegro will keep streaming silence to the voice even if the stream or mixer are stopped or detached.
@seealso(ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_RESUME_DRAWING)
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_RESUME_DRAWING
When a display receives this event, it may resume drawing again, and it must call @link(al_acknowledge_drawing_resume) immediately.

This is currently only relevant for Android and iOS. The event will be sent when an application returns from background mode and is allowed to draw to the display again, in addition to @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_SWITCH_IN). The latter event may also be sent in a situation where the application is already active, for example when a popup in front of it closes.

@bold(Note)

Unlike @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_FOUND) it is not necessary to reload any bitmaps when you receive this event.
@seealso(ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_HALT_DRAWING)

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT_TOUCH_BEGIN

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT_TOUCH_END
A touch ended.

Has the same fields as @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_TOUCH_BEGIN).
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT_TOUCH_MOVE
The position of a touch changed.

Has the same fields as @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_TOUCH_BEGIN).
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT_TOUCH_CANCEL
A touch was cancelled. This is device specific but could for example mean that a finger moved off the border of the device or moved so fast that it could not be tracked any longer.

Has the same fields as @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_TOUCH_BEGIN).

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_CONNECTED
This event is sent when a physical display is connected to the device Allegro runs on. Currently, on most platforms, Allegro supports only a single physical display. However, on iOS, a secondary physical display is supported.
@unorderedlist(

those described in @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_TYPE).
@seealso(ALLEGRO_GET_EVENT_TYPE)
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_GET_EVENT_TYPE
Makes an event type identifier, which is a 32-bit integer. Usually, but not
necessarily, this will be made from four 8-bit character codes, for example:
@longcode(!
  MY_EVENT_TYPE := ALLEGRO_GET_EVENT_TYPE ('MINE');
!)
IDs less than 1024 are reserved for Allegro or its addons. Don't use
anything lower than @code(ALLEGRO_GET_EVENT_TYPE @(#0#0#4#0@)).

You should try to make your IDs unique so they don't clash with any 3rd
party code you may be using. Be creative. Numbering from 1024 is not
creative.

If you need multiple identifiers, you could define them like this:
@longcode(!
  BASE_EVENT := ALLEGRO_GET_EVENT_TYPE ('MINE');
  BARK_EVENT := BASE_EVENT + 1;
  MEOW_EVENT := BASE_EVENT + 2;
  SQUAWK_EVENT := BASE_EVENT + 3;

An opaque type representing an open display or window.
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_JOYSTICKptr
A pointer to an abstract data representing a physical joystick.
@seealso(al_get_joystick)

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE
An event source is any object which can generate events.  For example, an
@link(ALLEGRO_DISPLAYptr) can generate events, and you can get the
@code(ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE) pointer from an @code(ALLEGRO_DISPLAYptr) with
@link(al_get_display_event_source).

You may create your own "user" event sources that emit custom events.

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_KEYBOARD_EVENT
Contains the keyboard events information. @seealso(ALLEGRO_EVENT)
@member keycode The code corresponding to the physical key which was pressed or released. See the @link(Keyboard) section for the list of @code(ALLEGRO_KEY_* ) constants.
@member modifiers This is a bitfield of the modifier keys which were pressed when the event occurred. See @link(Keyboard modifier flags) for the constants.
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_KEYBOARD_EVENT.unichar
A Unicode code point (character). This may be zero or negative if the
event was generated for a non-visible "character", such as an arrow or
Function key. In that case you can act upon the keycode field.

Some special keys will set the unichar field to their standard ASCII
values: Tab=9, Return=13, Escape=27. In addition if you press the
Control key together with A to Z the unichar field will have the values
1 to 26. For example Ctrl-A will set unichar to 1 and Ctrl-H will set it
to 8.

As of Allegro 5.0.2 there are some inconsistencies in the treatment of
Backspace (8 or 127) and Delete (127 or 0) keys on different platforms.
These can be worked around by checking the keycode field.

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_MOUSE_EVENT

@member x x-coordinate.
@member y y-coordinate.
@member z z-coordinate. This usually means the vertical axis of a mouse wheel, where up is positive and down is negative.

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_TOUCH_EVENT
Contains the touch input events information. @seealso(ALLEGRO_EVENT)
@member id An identifier for this touch. If supported by the device it will stay the same for events from the same finger until the touch ends.

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_USER_EVENT
An event structure that can be emitted by user event sources. These are the public fields:
@longcode(!
  source: ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE;
  data1: AL_DATA_INTPTR_T;
  data2: AL_DATA_INTPTR_T;
  data3: AL_DATA_INTPTR_T;
  data4: AL_DATA_INTPTR_T;
!)
Like all other event types this structure is a part of the @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT) union. To access the fields in an @code(ALLEGRO_EVENT) variable @code(ev), you would use:
@preformatted(
  ev.user.source
  ev.user.data1
  ev.user.data2
  ev.user.data3
  ev.user.data4
)
To create a new user event you would do this:
@longcode(!
VAR
  MyEventSource: ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE;
  MyEvent: ALLEGRO_EVENT;
  SomeVar: REAL;
BEGIN
  al_init_user_event_source (MyEventSource);
  MyEvent.user.ftype := ALLEGRO_GET_EVENT_TYPE ('MINE');
  MyEvent.user.data1.int_value := 1;
  MyEvent.user.data2.ptr_value := @SomeVar;
  al_emit_user_event (MyEventSource, MyEvent, NIL)
END;
!)
Event type identifiers for user events are assigned by the user. Please see the documentation for @link(ALLEGRO_GET_EVENT_TYPE) for the rules you should follow when assigning identifiers.
@seealso(al_emit_user_event) @seealso(ALLEGRO_GET_EVENT_TYPE) @seealso(al_init_user_event_source)
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_EVENT
An @code(ALLEGRO_EVENT) is an union of all builtin event structures, i.e. it is an object large enough to hold the data of any event type. All events have the following fields in common:
@unorderedlist(
  @item(@code(@bold(ftype @(@link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_TYPE)@))) Indicates the type of event.)
  @item(@code(@bold(any.source @(ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCEptr@))) The event source
         which generated the event.)
  @item(@code(@bold(any.timestamp @(DOUBLE@))) When the event was generated.)
)
By examining the type field you can then access type-specific fields. The
@code(any.source) field tells you which event source generated that
particular event. The @code(any.timestamp) field tells you when the event
was generated. The time is referenced to the same starting point as
@link(al_get_time).

Each event is of one of the following types, with the usable fields given.
@unorderedlist(
  @item(@link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_JOYSTICK_AXIS))
  @item(@link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_JOYSTICK_BUTTON_DOWN))
  @item(@link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_JOYSTICK_BUTTON_UP))

  @item(@link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_DISCONNECTED))
)
@member any This is to allow the user to access the other fields which are common to all event types, without using some specific type structure.

#Allegro5.al_init_user_event_source
Initialices an event source for emitting user events. The space for the event
source must already have been allocated.

One possible way of creating custom event sources is to derive other
structures with @code(ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE) at the head, e.g.
@longcode(!
TYPE
  THINGptr = ^THING;
  THING = RECORD
    event_source: ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE;
    field1, field2: INTEGER;
    { etc. }
  END;

FUNCTION CreateThing: THINGptr;
BEGIN
  RESULT := getmem (sizeof (THING));
  IF RESULT <> NIL THEN
  BEGIN
    al_init_user_event_source (@@(RESULT^.event_source));
    RESULT^.field1 := 0;
    RESULT^.field2 := 0
  END
END;
!)

The advantage here is that the @code(THING) pointer will be the same as the
@code(ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE) pointer. Events emitted by the event source will
have the event source pointer as the source field, from which you can get a
pointer to a @code(THING) by a simple cast (after ensuring checking the event
is of the correct type).

However, it is only one technique and you are not obliged to use it.

The user event source will never be destroyed automatically. You must destroy
it manually with @code(al_destroy_user_event_source).
@seealso(ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE) @seealso(al_destroy_user_event_source)
@seealso(al_emit_user_event) @seealso(ALLEGRO_USER_EVENT)
#Allegro5.al_destroy_user_event_source
Destroys an event source initialised with @link(al_init_user_event_source).

This does not free the memory, as that was user allocated to begin with.
@seealso(ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE)
#Allegro5.al_emit_user_event
Emits an event from a user event source. The event source must have been initialised with @link(al_init_user_event_source).
@Returns(@false if the event source isn't registered with any queues, hence the event wouldn't have been delivered into any queues.)

Events are copied in and out of event queues, so after this function returns the memory pointed to by event may be freed or reused. Some fields of the event being passed in may be modified by the function.

Reference counting will be performed if @code(dtor) is not @nil. Whenever a copy of the event is made, the reference count increases. You need to call @link(al_unref_user_event) to decrease the reference count once you are done with a user event that you have received from @link(al_get_next_event), @link(al_peek_next_event), @link(al_wait_for_event), etc.

Once the reference count drops to zero @code(dtor) will be called with a copy of the event as an argument. It should free the resources associated with the event, but not the event itself (since it is just a copy).

If @code(dtor) is @nil then reference counting will not be performed. It is safe, but unnecessary, to call @code(al_unref_user_event) on non-reference counted user events.

You can use @code(al_emit_user_event) to emit both user and non-user events from your user event source. Note that emitting input events will not update the corresponding input device states. For example, you may emit an event of type @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_DOWN), but it will not update the @link(ALLEGRO_KEYBOARD_STATE) returned by @link(al_get_keyboard_state).
@seealso(ALLEGRO_USER_EVENT) @seealso(al_unref_user_event) @seealso(ALLEGRO_EVENT_DTOR_PROC)
#Allegro5.al_unref_user_event
Decreases the reference count of a user-defined event. This must be called on any user event that you get from @link(al_get_next_event), @link(al_peek_next_event), @link(al_wait_for_event), etc. which is reference counted. This function does nothing if the event is not reference counted.

#Allegro5.al_get_event_source_data

#Allegro5.al_register_event_source
Register the event source with the event queue specified. An event source may be registered with any number of event queues simultaneously, or none. Trying to register an event source with the same event queue more than once does nothing.
@seealso(al_unregister_event_source) @seealso(ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE)
#Allegro5.al_unregister_event_source
Unregister an event source with an event queue. If the event source is not actually registered with the event queue, nothing happens.

#Allegro5.al_pause_event_queue
Pauses or resumes accepting new events into the event queue (to resume, pass @false for pause). Events already in the queue are unaffected.

While a queue is paused, any events which would be entered into the queue are simply ignored. This is an alternative to unregistering then re-registering all event sources from the event queue, if you just need to prevent events piling up in the queue for a while.

@seealso(al_get_new_display_refresh_rate)
#Allegro5.al_set_new_display_flags
Sets various flags to be used when creating new displays on the calling
thread. flags is a bitfield containing any reasonable combination of the following:
@unorderedlist(
  @item(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_WINDOWED)) Prefer a windowed mode.

    Under multi-head X (not XRandR/TwinView), the use of more than one adapter is impossible due to bugs in X and GLX. @link(al_create_display) will fail if more than one adapter is attempted to be used.)
  @item(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW)) Make the window span the entire screen. Unlike @code(ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN) this will never attempt to modify the screen resolution. Instead the pixel dimensions of the created display will be the same as the desktop.

    The passed width and height are only used if the window is switched out of fullscreen mode later but will be ignored initially.

    Under Windows and X11 a fullscreen display created with this flag will behave differently from one created with the @code(ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN) flag - even if the @code(ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN) display is passed the desktop dimensions. The exact difference is platform dependent, but some things which may be different is how alt-tab works, how fast you can toggle between fullscreen/windowed mode or how additional monitors behave while your display is in fullscreen mode.

    Additionally under X, the use of more than one adapter in multi-head mode or with true Xinerama enabled is impossible due to bugs in X/GLX, creation will fail if more than one adapter is attempted to be used.)
  @item(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN)) Prefer a fullscreen mode.

    Under X the use of more than one FULLSCREEN display when using multi-head X, or true Xinerama is not possible due to bugs in X and GLX, display creation will fail if more than one adapter is attempted to be used.

    @bold(Note:) Prefer using @code(ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW) as it typically provides a better user experience as the monitor doesn't change resolution and switching away from your game via Alt-Tab works smoothly. @code(ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN) is typically less well supported compared to @code(ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW).)
  @item(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_RESIZABLE)) The display is resizable @(only applicable if combined with @code(ALLEGRO_WINDOWED)@).)

  @item(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_OPENGL_3_0)) Require the driver to provide an initialized OpenGL context compatible with OpenGL version 3.0.)
  @item(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE)) If this flag is set, the OpenGL context created with @code(ALLEGRO_OPENGL_3_0) will be forward compatible only, meaning that all of the OpenGL API declared deprecated in OpenGL 3.0 will not be supported. Currently, a display created with this flag will not be compatible with Allegro drawing routines; the display option @code(ALLEGRO_COMPATIBLE_DISPLAY) will be set to false.)
  @item(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_OPENGL_ES_PROFILE)) Used together with @code(ALLEGRO_OPENGL), requests that the OpenGL context uses the OpenGL ES profile. A specific version can be requested with @link(al_set_new_display_option). @bold(Note:) Currently this is only supported by the X11/GLX driver.)

#Allegro5.al_create_display
Creates a display, or window, with the specified dimensions. The parameters of the display are determined by the last calls to @code(al_set_new_display_* ). Default parameters are used if none are set explicitly. Creating a new display will automatically make it the active one, with the backbuffer selected for drawing.

Each display that uses OpenGL as a backend has a distinct OpenGL rendering context associated with it. See @link(al_set_target_bitmap) for the discussion about rendering contexts.
@returns(@nil on error.)

#Allegro5.al_destroy_display
Destroys a display.

If the target bitmap of the calling thread is tied to the display, then it implies a call to @code(al_set_target_bitmap @(@nil@);) before the display is destroyed.

That special case notwithstanding, you should make sure no threads are currently targeting a bitmap which is tied to the display before you destroy it.
@seealso(al_set_target_bitmap)
#Allegro5.al_get_current_display
Returns the display that is "current" for the calling thread, or @nil if there is none.
@seealso(al_set_target_bitmap)
#Allegro5.al_set_target_bitmap
This function selects the bitmap to which all subsequent drawing operations in the calling thread will draw to. To return to drawing to a display, set the backbuffer of the display as the target bitmap, using @link(al_get_backbuffer).  As a convenience, you may also use @link(al_set_target_backbuffer).

Each video bitmap is tied to a display. When a video bitmap is set to as the target bitmap, the display that the bitmap belongs to is automatically made "current" for the calling thread (if it is not current already). Then drawing other bitmaps which are tied to the same display can be hardware accelerated.

A single display cannot be current for multiple threads simultaneously. If you need to release a display, so it is not current for the calling thread, call @code(al_set_target_bitmap @(@nil@);)

Setting a memory bitmap as the target bitmap will not change which display is current for the calling thread.

On some platforms, Allegro automatically backs up the contents of video bitmaps because they may be occasionally lost (see discussion in @link(al_create_bitmap)'s documentation). If you're completely recreating the bitmap contents often (e.g. every frame) then you will get much better performance by creating the target bitmap with @code(ALLEGRO_NO_PRESERVE_TEXTURE) flag.

@bold(OpenGL note:)

Framebuffer objects (FBOs) allow OpenGL to directly draw to a bitmap, which is very fast. When using an OpenGL display, if all of the following conditions are met an FBO will be created for use with the bitmap:@unorderedlist(
    @item(The @code(GL_EXT_framebuffer_object) OpenGL extension is available.)
    @item(The bitmap is not a memory bitmap.)
    @item(The bitmap is not currently locked.)
)
In Allegro 5.0.0, you had to be careful as an FBO would be kept around until the bitmap is destroyed or you explicitly called @link(al_remove_opengl_fbo) on the bitmap, wasting resources. In newer versions, FBOs will be freed automatically when the bitmap is no longer the target bitmap, unless you have called @link(al_get_opengl_fbo) to retrieve the FBO id.

In the following example, no FBO will be created:
@longcode(!
lock := al_lock_bitmap (bitmap);
al_set_target_bitmap (bitmap);
al_put_pixel (x, y, color);
al_unlock_bitmap (bitmap);
!)
The above allows using @link(al_put_pixel) on a locked bitmap without creating an FBO.

In this example an FBO is created however:
@longcode(!
al_set_target_bitmap (bitmap);
al_draw_line (x1, y1, x2, y2, color, 0);
!)
An OpenGL command will be used to directly draw the line into the bitmap's associated texture.
@seealso(al_get_target_bitmap) @seealso(al_set_target_backbuffer)
#Allegro5.al_set_target_backbuffer
Same as @code(al_set_target_bitmap@(al_get_backbuffer@(display@)@);).
@seealso(al_set_target_bitmap) @seealso(al_get_backbuffer)
#Allegro5.al_get_backbuffer
Returns a special bitmap representing the back-buffer of the display.

Care should be taken when using the backbuffer bitmap (and its sub-bitmaps) as the source bitmap (e.g as the bitmap argument to @link(al_draw_bitmap)).  Only untransformed operations are hardware accelerated. These consist of @link(al_draw_bitmap) and @link(al_draw_bitmap_region) when the current transformation is the identity. If the tranformation is not the identity, or some other drawing operation is used, the call will be routed through the memory bitmap routines, which are slow. If you need those operations to be accelerated, then first copy a region of the backbuffer into a temporary bitmap (via the @link(al_draw_bitmap) and @link(al_draw_bitmap_region)), and then use that temporary bitmap as the source bitmap.
#Allegro5.al_get_target_bitmap
Returns the target bitmap of the calling thread. @seealso(al_set_target_bitmap)

#Allegro5.al_acknowledge_resize
When the user receives a resize event (@link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_RESIZE) from a resizable display, if they wish the display to be resized they must call this function to let the graphics driver know that it can now resize the display.

Adjusts the clipping rectangle to the full size of the backbuffer. This also resets the backbuffers projection transform to default orthographic transform (see @link(al_use_projection_transform)).

Note that a resize event may be outdated by the time you acknowledge it;  there could be further resize events generated in the meantime.
@return(@true on success.)
@seealso(al_resize_display) @seealso(ALLEGRO_EVENT)
#Allegro5.al_resize_display
Resizes the display.  This works on both fullscreen and windowed displays, regardless of the @code(ALLEGRO_RESIZABLE) flag.

Adjusts the clipping rectangle to the full size of the backbuffer.
@returns(@true on success, or @false on error.)
@seealso(al_acknowledge_resize)
#Allegro5.al_flip_display
Copies or updates the front and back buffers so that what has been drawn previously on the currently selected display becomes visible on screen. Pointers to the special back buffer bitmap remain valid and retain their semantics as the back buffer, although the contents may have changed.

Several display options change how this function behaves:
@unorderedlist(
 @item(With @code(ALLEGRO_SINGLE_BUFFER), no flipping is done. You still have
     to call this function to display graphics, depending on how the used
     graphics system works.)
 @item(The @code(ALLEGRO_SWAP_METHOD) option may have additional information
     about what kind of operation is used internally to flip the front and back
     buffers.)
 @item(If @code(ALLEGRO_VSYNC) is 1, this function will force waiting for
     vsync. If @code(ALLEGRO_VSYNC) is 2, this function will not wait for
     vsync. With many drivers the vsync behavior is controlled by the user and
     not the application, and @code(ALLEGRO_VSYNC) will not be set; in this
     case @code(al_flip_display) will wait for vsync depending on the settings
     set in the system's graphics preferences.)
)
@seealso(al_set_new_display_flags) @seealso(al_set_new_display_option) @seealso(al_wait_for_vsync)
#Allegro5.al_update_display_region
Does the same as al_flip_display, but tries to update only the specified region. With many drivers this is not possible, but for some it can improve performance. If this is not supported, this function falls back to the behavior of @link(al_flip_display). You can query the support for this function using @code(al_get_display_option @(display, ALLEGRO_UPDATE_DISPLAY_REGION@)).
@seealso(al_flip_display) @seealso(al_get_display_option)
#Allegro5.al_is_compatible_bitmap
D3D and OpenGL allow sharing a texture in a way so it can be used for multiple windows. Each @link(ALLEGRO_BITMAPptr) created with @link(al_create_bitmap) however is usually tied to a single @code(ALLEGRO_DISPLAYptr). This function can be used to know if the bitmap is compatible with the given display, even if it is a different display to the one it was created with. It returns @true if the bitmap is compatible (things like a cached texture version can be used) and @false otherwise (blitting in the current display will be slow).

The only time this function is useful is if you are using multiple windows and need accelerated blitting of the same bitmaps to both.
@Returns(@true if the bitmap is compatible with the current display, @false otherwise. If there is no current display, @false is returned.)

#Allegro5.al_wait_for_vsync
Waits for the beginning of a vertical retrace. Some driver/card/monitor combinations may not be capable of this.

Note how @link(al_flip_display) usually already waits for the vertical retrace, so unless you are doing something special, there is no reason to call this function.
@returns(@false if not possible, @true if successful.)
@seealso(al_flip_display)

#Allegro5.al_get_display_event_source
Retrieves the associated event source. See the documentation on events for a list of the events displays will generate.

#Allegro5.al_set_display_icon
Changes the icon associated with the display (window).
@seealso(al_set_display_icons) @seealso(al_set_window_title)
#Allegro5.al_set_display_icons
Changes the icons associated with the display (window). Multiple icons can be provided for use in different contexts, e.g. window frame, taskbar, alt-tab popup. The number of icons must be at least one.

@bold(Note)

If the underlying OS requires an icon of a size not provided then one of the bitmaps will be scaled up or down to the required size. The choice of bitmap is implementation dependent.

#Allegro5.al_get_new_display_adapter
Gets the video adapter index where new displays will be created by the calling thread, if previously set with @link(al_set_new_display_adapter). Otherwise returns @code(ALLEGRO_DEFAULT_DISPLAY_ADAPTER).
@seealso(al_set_new_display_adapter)
#Allegro5.al_set_new_display_adapter
Sets the adapter to use for new displays created by the calling thread. The adapter has a monitor attached to it. Information about the monitor can be gotten using @link(al_get_num_video_adapters) and @link(al_get_monitor_info).

To return to the default behaviour, pass @code(ALLEGRO_DEFAULT_DISPLAY_ADAPTER).

#Allegro5.al_set_window_constraints
Constrains a non-fullscreen resizable display. The constraints are a hint only, and are not necessarily respected by the window environment. A value of 0 for any of the parameters indicates no constraint for that parameter.

The constraints will be applied to a display only after the @link(al_apply_window_constraints) function call.
@seealso(al_apply_window_constraints) (al_get_window_constraints)
#Allegro5.al_get_window_constraints
Gets the constraints for a non-fullscreen resizable display.
@seealso(al_set_window_constraints)
#Allegro5.al_apply_window_constraints
Enables or disables previously set constraints by @link(al_set_window_constraints) function.

If enabled, the specified display will be automatically resized to new sizes to conform constraints in next cases:
@unorderedlist(
  @item(The specified display is resizable, not maximized and is not in fullscreen mode.)
  @item(If the appropriate current display size (width or height) is less than the value of constraint. Applied to minimum constraints.)
  @item(If the appropriate current display size (width or height) is greater than the value of constraint. Applied to maximum constraints.)
)
Constrains are not applied when a display is toggle from windowed to maximized or fullscreen modes. When a display is toggle from maximized/fullscreen to windowed mode, then the display may be resized as described above. The later case is also possible when a user drags the maximized display via mouse.

If disabled, the specified display will stop using constraints.

@seealso(al_set_display_icon) @seealso(al_set_display_icons)

#Allegro5.al_set_new_display_option
Sets an extra display option, to be used when creating new displays on the
   calling thread.  Display options differ from display flags, and specify some
   details of the context to be created within the window itself.  These mainly
   have no effect on Allegro itself, but you may want to specify them, for
   example if you want to use multisampling.

The @code(importance) parameter can be either:@unorderedlist(
  @item(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_REQUIRE)) - The display will not be created if
     the setting can not be met.)
  @item(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_SUGGEST)) - If the setting is not available, the

  @item(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_DONTCARE)) - If you added a display option with
     one of the above two settings before, it will be removed again.  Else this

#Allegro5.al_hold_bitmap_drawing
Enables or disables deferred bitmap drawing. This allows for efficient drawing of many bitmaps that share a parent bitmap, such as sub-bitmaps from a tilesheet or simply identical bitmaps. Drawing bitmaps that do not share a parent is less efficient, so it is advisable to stagger bitmap drawing calls such that the parent bitmap is the same for large number of those calls. While deferred bitmap drawing is enabled, the only functions that can be used are the bitmap drawing functions and font drawing functions. Changing the state such as the blending modes will result in undefined behaviour. One exception to this rule are the non-projection transformations. It is possible to set a new transformation while the drawing is held.

No drawing is guaranteed to take place until you disable the hold. Thus, the idiom of this function's usage is to enable the deferred bitmap drawing, draw as many bitmaps as possible, taking care to stagger bitmaps that share parent bitmaps, and then disable deferred drawing. As mentioned above, this function also works with bitmap and truetype fonts, so if multiple lines of text need to be drawn, this function can speed things up.

#Allegro5.al_get_cpu_count
Returns the number of CPU cores that the system Allegro is running on has
and which could be detected, or a negative number if detection failed.  Even
if a positive number is returned, it might be that it is not correct.  For
example, Allegro running on a virtual machine will return the amount of
CPU's of the VM, and not that of the underlying system.

Furthermore even if the number is correct, this only gives you information
about the total CPU cores of the system Allegro runs on.  The amount of
cores available to your program may be less due to circumstances such as
programs that are currently running.

Therefore, it's best to use this for advisory purposes only.  It is
certainly a bad idea to make your program exclusive to systems for which
this function returns a certain "desirable" number.

This function may be called prior to @link(al_install_system) or @link(al_init).
#Allegro5.al_get_ram_size
Returns the size in MB of the random access memory that the system Allegro

it is not correct.  For example, Allegro running on a virtual machine will
return the amount of RAM of the VM, and not that of the underlying system.

Furthermore even if the number is correct, this only gives you information
about the total physical memory of the system Allegro runs on.  The memory
available to your program may be less due to circumstances such as virtual
memory, and other programs that are currently running.

Therefore, it's best to use this for advisory purposes only.  It is

Operations involving the depth buffer are also affected by @link(al_set_render_state).

For example, if @code(ALLEGRO_DEPTH_FUNCTION) is set to @code(ALLEGRO_RENDER_LESS) then depth buffer value of 1 represents infinite distance, and thus is a good value to use when clearing the depth buffer.

This function can be slow if called often; if you need to draw a lot of pixels consider using @link(al_draw_prim) with @code(ALLEGRO_PRIM_POINT_LIST) from the primitives addon.

#Allegro5.AL_FIXED
Allegro provides some routines for working with fixed point numbers, and defines the type @code(AL_FIXED) to be a signed 32-bit integer.  The high word is used for the integer part and the low word for the fraction, giving a range of -32768 to 32767 and an accuracy of about four or five decimal places.  Fixed point numbers can be assigned, compared, added, subtracted, negated and shifted (for multiplying or dividing by powers of two) using the normal integer operators, but you should take care to use the appropriate conversion routines when mixing fixed point with integer or floating point values. Writing @code(fixed_point_1 + fixed_point_2) is OK, but @code(fixed_point + integer) is not.

The only advantage of fixed point math routines is that you don't require a floating point coprocessor to use them.  This was great in the time period of i386 and i486 machines, but stopped being so useful with the coming of the Pentium class of processors.  From Pentium onwards, CPUs have increased their strength in floating point operations, equaling or even surpassing integer math performance.

Depending on the type of operations your program may need, using floating point types may be faster than fixed types if you are targeting a specific machine class. Many embedded processors have no FPUs so fixed point maths can be useful there.

#Allegro5.al_fixmul
A fixed point value can be multiplied or divided by an integer with the normal * and / operators.  To multiply two fixed point values, though, you must use this function.

Example:
@longcode(!
var

begin
{ This will put 30000 into Value. }
  Value := al_fixmul (al_itofix (10), al_itofix (3000))

#Allegro5.al_fixdiv
A fixed point value can be divided by an integer with the normal / operator.  To divide two fixed point values, though, you must use this function.  If a division by zero occurs, Allegro's errno will be set and the maximum possible value will be returned, but errno is not cleared if the operation is successful.  This means that if you are going to test for division by zero you should call @code(@link(al_set_errno) @(0@)) before calling @code(al_fixdiv).

Example:

@longcode(!
var
  Value: AL_FIXED;
begin
{ This will put 0.06060 Value. }
  Value := al_fixdiv (al_itofix (2), al_itofix (33));

This function is automatically called when Allegro is shut down.
@seealso(al_install_joystick)
#Allegro5.al_reconfigure_joysticks
Allegro is able to cope with users connecting and disconnected joystick devices on-the-fly. On existing platforms, the joystick event source will generate an event of type @code(ALLEGRO_EVENT_JOYSTICK_CONFIGURATION) when a device is plugged in or unplugged. In response, you should call @code(al_reconfigure_joysticks).

Afterwards, the number returned by @link(al_get_num_joysticks) may be different, and the handles returned by @link(al_get_joystick) may be different or be ordered differently.

All @link(ALLEGRO_JOYSTICKptr) handles remain valid, but handles for disconnected devices become inactive: their states will no longer update, and @link(al_get_joystick) will not return the handle. Handles for devices which remain connected will continue to represent the same devices. Previously inactive handles may become active again, being reused to represent newly connected devices.

It is possible that on some systems, Allegro won't be able to generate @code(ALLEGRO_EVENT_JOYSTICK_CONFIGURATION) events. If your game has an input configuration screen or similar, you may wish to call @code(al_reconfigure_joysticks) when entering that screen.

#Allegro5.al_set_mouse_wheel_precision
Sets the precision of the mouse wheel (the z and w coordinates). This precision manifests itself as a multiplier on the @code(dz) and @code(dw) fields in mouse events. It also affects the @code(z) and @code(w) fields of events and @link(ALLEGRO_MOUSE_STATE), but not in a simple way if you alter the precision often, so it is suggested to reset those axes to @code(0) when you change precision. Setting this to a high value allows you to detect small changes in those two axes for some high precision mice. A flexible way of using this precision is to set it to a high value (120 is likely sufficient for most, if not all, mice) and use a floating point @code(dz) and @code(dw) like so:
@longcode(!
VAR
  Event: ALLEGRO_EVENT;

@param(state Possible render states which can be one of @link(ALLEGRO_RENDER_STATE).)
@param(value Value to apply to the given @code(state).)



#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_TRANSFORM
Defines the generic transformation type, a 4x4 matrix. 2D transforms use only a small subsection of this matrix, namely the top left 2x2 matrix, and the right most 2x1 matrix, for a total of 6 values.
@member m A 4x4 float matrix.

#Allegro5.al_use_transform
Sets the transformation to be used for the the drawing operations on the target bitmap (each bitmap maintains its own transformation). Every drawing operation after this call will be transformed using this transformation. Call this function with an identity transformation to return to the default behaviour.

This function does nothing if there is no target bitmap.

The parameter is passed by reference as an optimization to avoid the overhead of stack copying. The reference will not be stored in the Allegro library so it is safe to pass references to local variables.
@longcode(!
PROCEDURE SetupMyTransformation;
VAR
  Transform: ALLEGRO_TRANSFORM;
BEGIN
  al_translate_transform (Transform, 5, 10);
  al_use_transform (Transform)
END;
!)
@param(trans Transformation to use.)
@seealso(al_get_current_transform) @seealso(al_transform_coordinates)
#Allegro5.al_use_projection_transform
Sets the projection transformation to be used for the the drawing operations on the target bitmap (each bitmap maintains its own projection transformation). Every drawing operation after this call will be transformed using this transformation. To return default behavior, call this function with an orthographic transform like so:
@longcode(!
VAR
  Trans: ALLEGRO_TRANSFORM;
BEGIN
  al_identity_transform (Trans);
  al_orthographic_transform (
    Trans,
    0, 0, -1.0,
    al_get_bitmap_width (Bitmap), al_get_bitmap_height (Bitmap), 1.0
  );
  al_set_target_bitmap (Bitmap);
  al_use_projection_transform (trans)
END;
!)
The orthographic transformation above is the default projection transform.

This function does nothing if there is no target bitmap. This function also does nothing if the bitmap is a memory bitmap (i.e. memory bitmaps always use an orthographic transform like the snippet above). Note that the projection transform will be reset to default if a video bitmap is converted to a memory bitmap. Additionally, if the bitmap in question is the backbuffer, it's projection transformation will be reset to default if it is resized. Lastly, when you draw a memory bitmap to a video bitmap with a custom projection transform, this transformation will be ignored (i.e. it'll be as if the projection transform of the target bitmap was temporarily reset to default).

The parameter is passed by reference as an optimization to avoid the overhead of stack copying. The reference will not be stored in the Allegro library so it is safe to pass references to local variables.

#Allegro5.al_build_transform
Builds a transformation given some parameters. This call is equivalent to calling the transformations in this order: make identity, rotate, scale, translate. This method is faster, however, than actually calling those functions.

@bold(Note)

this function was previously documented to be equivalent to a different (and more useful) order of operations: identity, scale, rotate, translate.

#Allegro5.al_build_camera_transform
Builds a transformation which can be used to transform 3D coordinates in world space to camera space. This involves translation and a rotation. The function expects three coordinate triplets: The camera's position, the position the camera is looking at and an up vector. The up vector does not need to be of unit length and also does not need to be perpendicular to the view direction - it can usually just be the world up direction (most commonly 0/1/0).

For example:
@longcode(!
al_build_camera_transform (
    T,
    1, 1, 1,
    5, 5, 5,
    0, 1, 0
);
!)
This create a transformation for a camera standing at 1/1/1 and looking towards 5/5/5.

@bold(Note:) If the position and look parameters are identical, or if the up direction is parallel to the view direction, an identity matrix is created.

Another example which will simply re-create the identity matrix:
@longcode(!
al_build_camera_transform (
    T,
    0, 0,  0,
    0, 0, -1,
    0, 1,  0
);
!)
An example where the up vector will cause the camera to lean (roll) by 45 degrees:
@longcode(!
al_build_camera_transform (
    T,
    1, 1, 1,
    5, 5, 5,
    1, 1, 0
);

Transposes the matrix of the given transform. This can be used for inversing a rotation transform. For example:
@longcode(#
al_build_camera_transform (camera, 0, 0, 0, x, y, z, xu, yu, zu)
al_copy_transform (inverse, camera)
al_transpose_transform (camera)

  position is 0/0/0 as in the example. }
#)
@seealso(al_identity_transform)
#Allegro5.al_check_inverse
Checks if the transformation has an inverse using the supplied tolerance. Tolerance should be a small value between 0 and 1, with 1e-7 being sufficient for most applications.

In this function tolerance specifies how close the determinant can be to 0 (if the determinant is 0, the transformation has no inverse). Thus the smaller the tolerance you specify, the "worse" transformations will pass this test. Using a tolerance of 1e-7 will catch errors greater than 1/1000's of a pixel, but let smaller errors pass. That means that if you transformed a point by a transformation and then transformed it again by the inverse transformation that passed this check, the resultant point should less than 1/1000's of a pixel away from the original point.

Note that this check is superfluous most of the time if you never touched the transformation matrix values yourself. The only thing that would cause the transformation to not have an inverse is if you applied a 0 (or very small) scale to the transformation or you have a really large translation. As long as the scale is comfortably above 0, the transformation will be invertible.

#Allegro5.al_orthographic_transform
Combines the given transformation with an orthographic transformation which maps the screen rectangle to the given left/top and right/bottom coordinates.

near/far is the z range, coordinates outside of that range will get clipped. Normally -1/1 is fine because all 2D graphics will have a z coordinate of 0. However if you for example do @code(al_draw_rectangle (0, 0, 100, 100)) and rotate around the x axis ("towards the screen") make sure your z range allows values from -100 to 100 or the rotated rectangle will get clipped.

Also, if you are using a depth buffer the z range decides the depth resolution. For example if you have a 16 bit depth buffer there are only 65536 discrete depth values. So if your near/far is set to -1000000/1000000 most of the z positions would not result in separate depth values which could lead to artifacts.

#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_SHADERptr
Pointer to an @code(ALLEGRO_SHADER).

An @code(ALLEGRO_SHADER) is a program that runs on the GPU.  It combines both a vertex and a pixel shader. (In OpenGL terms, an @code(ALLEGRO_SHADER) is actually a program which has one or more shaders attached. This can be confusing.)

The source code for the underlying vertex or pixel shader can be provided either as GLSL or HLSL, depending on the value of @link(ALLEGRO_SHADER_PLATFORM) used when creating it.
@seealso(al_create_shader)
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_SHADER_TYPE
Used with @link(al_attach_shader_source) and @link(al_attach_shader_source_file) to specify how to interpret the attached source.
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_VERTEX_SHADER
A vertex shader is executed for each vertex it is used with. The program will output exactly one vertex at a time.

When Allegro's graphics are being used then in addition to all vertices of primitives from the primitives addon, each drawn bitmap also consists of four vertices.
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_PIXEL_SHADER
A pixel shader is executed for each pixel it is used with.  The program will output exactly one pixel at a time - either in the backbuffer or in the current target bitmap.

With Allegro's builtin graphics this means the shader is for example called for each destination pixel of the output of an @link(al_draw_bitmap) call.

A more accurate term for pixel shader would be fragment shader since one final pixel in the target bitmap is not necessarily composed of only a single output but of multiple fragments (for example when multi-sampling is being used).
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_SHADER_PLATFORM
The underlying platform which the @link(ALLEGRO_SHADERptr) is built on top of, which dictates the language used to program the shader.

#Allegro5.al_create_shader
Creates a shader object.

The platform argument is one of the @link(ALLEGRO_SHADER_PLATFORM) values,
and specifies the type of shader object to create, and which language is
used to program the shader.

The shader platform must be compatible with the type of display that you
will use the shader with.  For example, you cannot create and use a HLSL
shader on an OpenGL display, nor a GLSL shader on a Direct3D display.

The @code(ALLEGRO_SHADER_AUTO) value automatically chooses the appropriate
platform for the display currently targeted by the calling thread; there
must be such a display.  It will create a GLSL shader for an OpenGL
display, and a HLSL shader for a Direct3D display.
@return(A pointer to the shader object on success. Otherwise, returns @nil.)
@seealso(al_attach_shader_source) @seealso(al_attach_shader_source_file)

@seealso(al_destroy_shader) @seealso(al_get_shader_platform)
#Allegro5.al_attach_shader_source
Attaches the shader's source code to the shader object and compiles it. Passing @nil deletes the underlying (OpenGL or DirectX) shader.  See also @link(al_attach_shader_source_file) if you prefer to obtain your shader source from an external file.

If you do not use @code(ALLEGRO_PROGRAMMABLE_PIPELINE) Allegro's graphics functions will not use any shader specific functions themselves. In case of a system with no fixed function pipeline (like OpenGL ES 2 or OpenGL 3 or 4) this means Allegro's drawing functions cannot be used.

TODO: Is @code(ALLEGRO_PROGRAMMABLE_PIPELINE) set automatically in this case?

When @code(ALLEGRO_PROGRAMMABLE_PIPELINE) is used the following shader uniforms are provided by Allegro and can be accessed in your shaders:
@definitionlist(
 @itemlabel(@bold(al_projview_matrix)) @item(matrix for Allegro's orthographic
      projection multiplied by the al_use_transform matrix. The type is
      @code(mat4) in GLSL, and @code(float4x4) in HLSL.)
 @itemlabel(@bold(al_use_tex)) @item(whether or not to use the bound texture. The type
      is @code(bool) in both GLSL and HLSL.)
 @itemlabel(@bold(al_tex)) @item(the texture if one is bound. The type is
      @code(sampler2D) in GLSL and @code(texture) in HLSL.)
 @itemlabel(@bold(al_use_tex_matrix)) @item(whether or not to use a texture matrix
      @(used by the primitives addon@). The type is @code(bool) in both GLSL
      and HLSL.)
 @itemlabel(@bold(al_tex_matrix)) @item(the texture matrix @(used by the primitives
      addon@). Your shader should multiply the texture coordinates by this
      matrix. The type is @code(mat4) in GLSL, and @code(float4x4) in HLSL.)
)

For GLSL shaders the vertex attributes are passed using the following variables:
@definitionlist(
 @itemlabel(@bold(al_pos)) @item(vertex position attribute. Type is @code(vec4).)
 @itemlabel(@bold(al_texcoord)) @item(vertex texture coordinate attribute. Type is @code(vec2).)
 @itemlabel(@bold(al_color)) @item(vertex color attribute. Type is @code(vec4).)
)

For HLSL shaders the vertex attributes are passed using the following semantics:
@definitionlist(
 @itemlabel(@bold(POSITION0)) @item(vertex position attribute. Type is @code(float4).)
 @itemlabel(@bold(TEXCOORD0)) @item(vertex texture coordinate attribute. Type is @code(float2).)
 @itemlabel(@bold(TEXCOORD1)) @item(vertex color attribute. Type is @code(float4).)
)

Also, each shader variable has a corresponding macro name that can be used
when defining the shaders using string literals. Don't use these macros with
the other shader functions as that will lead to undefined behavior.

 @item(@code(ALLEGRO_SHADER_VAR_PROJVIEW_MATRIX) for "al_projview_matrix")

Destroy a shader. Any bitmaps which currently use the shader will implicitly stop using the shader. In multi-threaded programs, be careful that no such bitmaps are being accessed by other threads at the time.

As a convenience, if the target bitmap of the calling thread is using the shader then the shader is implicitly unused before being destroyed.

@seealso(al_create_shader)

#Allegro5.al_set_shader_sampler
Sets a texture sampler uniform and texture unit of the current target bitmap's shader. The given bitmap must be a video bitmap.

Different samplers should use different units. The bitmap passed to Allegro's drawing functions uses the 0th unit, so if you're planning on using the @code(al_tex) variable in your pixel shader as well as another sampler, set the other sampler to use a unit different from 0. With the primitives addon, it is possible to free up the 0th unit by passing @nil as the texture argument to the relevant drawing functions. In this case, you may set a sampler to use the 0th unit and thus not use @code(al_tex) (the @code(al_use_tex) variable will be set to @code(false)).
@return(@true on success. Otherwise returns @false, e.g. if the uniform by that name does not exist in the shader.)

@seealso(al_use_shader)
#Allegro5.al_set_shader_int_vector
Sets an integer vector array uniform of the current target bitmap's shader.
The @code(num_components) parameter can take one of the values 1, 2, 3 or 4.
If it is 1 then an array of @code(num_elems) integer elements is added.
Otherwise each added array element is assumed to be a vector with 2, 3 or 4 components in it.

For example, if you have a GLSL uniform declared as uniform @code(ivec3
flowers[4]) or an HLSL uniform declared as uniform @code(int3 flowers[4]),
then you'd use this function from your code like so:

Returns a string containing the source code to Allegro's default vertex or pixel shader appropriate for the passed platform. The @code(ALLEGRO_SHADER_AUTO) value means GLSL is used if OpenGL is being used otherwise HLSL.  @code(ALLEGRO_SHADER_AUTO) requires that there is a current display set on the calling thread.

It is typically wrong to call al_init anywhere except the final game binary. In particular, do not call it inside a shared library unless you know what you're doing. In those cases, it is better to call @link(al_install_system) either with a @nil @code(atexit_ptr), or with a pointer to @code(atexit) provided by the user of this shared library.
@seealso(al_uninstall_system) @seealso(al_get_system_id)

#Allegro5.al_install_system
Initializes the Allegro system.  No other Allegro functions can be called before this (with one or two exceptions).
@param(version Should always be set to @link(ALLEGRO_VERSION_INT).)
@param(atexit_ptr If non-@nil, and if hasn't been done already, @code(al_uninstall_system) will be registered as an atexit function. @code(atexit) is a function provided by standard C runtime library.  It allows similar functionality than @code(FINALIZATION) section in Pascal.)

@seealso(al_init) @seealso(al_uninstall_system) @seealso(al_get_system_id)
#Allegro5.al_uninstall_system

In most cases you don't need to call this, because it's called by @code(allegro5.pas) @code(FINALIZATION) section.
@seealso(al_init) @seealso(al_install_system)
#Allegro5.al_get_system_config(void)
Returns the system configuration structure. The returned configuration should not be destroyed with @link(al_destroy_config). This is mainly used for configuring Allegro and its addons. You may populate this configuration before Allegro is installed to control things like the logging levels and other features.

Allegro will try to populate this configuration by loading a configuration file from a few different locations, in this order:
@unorderedlist(
  @item(Unix only: /etc/allegro5rc)
  @item(Unix only: $HOME/allegro5rc)
  @item(Unix only: $HOME/.allegro5rc)
  @item(allegro5.cfg next to the executable)
)
If multiple copies are found, then they are merged using @link(al_merge_config_into).

The contents of this file are documented inside a prototypical allegro5.cfg that you can find in the @code(resources) directory of the distributions of Allegro.pas.

Note that Allegro will not look into that file unless you make a copy of it and place it next to your executable!
#allegro5.al_get_system_id
Returns the platform that Allegro is running on.
@seealso(ALLEGRO_SYSTEM_ID)

#Allegro5.al_inhibit_screensaver
This function allows the user to stop the system screensaver from starting up if @true is passed, or resets the system back to the default state (the state at program start) if @false is passed.
@returns(@true if the state was set successfully, otherwise @false.)



#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_THREADptr

@seealso(al_create_thread)
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_MUTEXptr
An opaque structure representing a mutex.

@seealso(al_create_cond)
#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_THREAD_METHOD
Defines the method used by threads.
@seealso(al_create_thread)

#Allegro5.al_create_thread
Spawns a new thread which begins executing @code(proc).  The new thread is passed its own thread handle and the value @code(arg).

@Return(A pointer to the thread on success.  Otherwise, returns @nil if there was an error.)
@seealso(al_run_detached_thread) @seealso(al_start_thread) @seealso(al_join_thread) @seealso(al_destroy_thread)
#Allegro5.al_start_thread
When a @code(thread) is created, it is initially in a suspended state.  Calling @code(al_start_thread) will start its actual execution.

Starting a thread which has already been started does nothing.
@seealso(al_run_detached_thread) @seealso(al_create_thread) @seealso(al_join_thread)
#Allegro5.al_join_thread
Waits for the @code(thread) to finish executing.  This implicitly calls @link(al_set_thread_should_stop) first.
@seealso(al_create_thread) @seealso(al_join_thread_ex) @seealso(al_get_thread_should_stop) @seealso(al_destroy_thread)

@seealso(al_join_thread) @seealso(al_get_thread_should_stop)
#Allegro5.al_get_thread_should_stop
Checks if another thread is waiting for thread to stop. Threads which run in a loop should check this periodically and act on it when convenient.

@bold(Note:) We don’t support forceful killing of threads.
@return(@true if another thread has called @link(al_join_thread) or @link(al_set_thread_should_stop) on this thread.)
@seealso(al_join_thread) @seealso(al_set_thread_should_stop)
#Allegro5.al_destroy_thread
Frees the resources used by a @code(thread). Implicitly performs @code(al_join_thread) on the thread if it hasn’t been done already.

Does nothing if thread is @nil.
@seealso(al_join_thread)
#Allegro5.al_run_detached_thread
Runs the passed function in its own thread, with @code(arg) passed to it as only parameter. This is similar to calling @link(al_create_thread), @link(al_start_thread) and (after the thread has finished) @code(al_destroy_thread) - but you don’t have the possibility of ever calling @code(al_join_thread) on the thread.

#Allegro5.al_create_mutex
Creates the mutex object (a mutual exclusion device). The mutex may or may not support “recursive” locking.
@return(The mutex on success or @nil on error.)
@seealso(al_create_mutex_recursive) @seealso(al_lock_mutex) @seealso(al_destroy_mutex)
#Allegro5.al_create_mutex_recursive
Creates the mutex object (a mutual exclusion device), with support for “recursive” locking. That is, the mutex will count the number of times it has been locked by the same thread. If the caller tries to acquire a lock on the mutex when it already holds the lock then the count is incremented. The mutex is only unlocked when the thread releases the lock on the mutex an equal number of times, i.e. the count drops down to zero.
@seealso(al_create_mutex)
#Allegro5.al_lock_mutex
Acquires the lock on @code(mutex). If the @code(mutex) is already locked by another thread, the call will block until the @code(mutex) becomes available and locked.

If the @code(mutex) is already locked by the calling thread, then the behaviour depends on whether the @code(mutex) was created with @link(al_create_mutex) or @link(al_create_mutex_recursive). In the former case, the behaviour is undefined; the most likely behaviour is deadlock. In the latter case, the count in the mutex will be incremented and the call will return immediately.

We don’t yet have @code(al_mutex_trylock).
@seealso(al_create_mutex) @seealso( al_unlock_mutex)
#Allegro5.al_unlock_mutex
Releases the lock on @code(mutex) if the calling thread holds the lock on it.

If the calling thread doesn’t hold the lock, or if the @code(mutex) is not locked, undefined behaviour results.
@seealso(al_lock_mutex)
#Allegro5.al_destroy_mutex
Frees the resources used by the @code(mutex). The @code(mutex) should be unlocked. Destroying a locked @code(mutex) results in undefined behaviour.

Does nothing if @code(mutex) is @nil.
@seealso(al_create_mutex)

#Allegro5.al_create_cond
Creates a condition variable.
@return(The condition value on success or @nil on error.)
@seealso(al_wait_cond) @seealso(al_destroy_cond)
#Allegro5.al_destroy_cond
Destroys a condition variable.

Destroying a condition variable which has threads block on it results in undefined behaviour.

Does nothing if @code(cond) is @nil.
@seealso(al_create_cond)
#Allegro5.al_wait_cond
On entering this function, @code(mutex) must be locked by the calling thread. The function will atomically release @code(mutex) and block on @code(cond). The function will return when @code(cond) is @italic(“signalled”), acquiring the lock on the mutex in the process.

Example of proper use:
@longcode(!
al_lock_mutex (Mutex);
WHILE something_not_true DO
  al_wait_cond (cond, mutex);
do_something;
al_unlock_mutex (mutex);
!)
The @code(mutex) should be locked before checking the condition, and should be rechecked @code(al_wait_cond) returns. @code(al_wait_cond) can return for other reasons than the condition becoming true (e.g. the process was signalled). If multiple threads are blocked on the condition variable, the condition may no longer be @true by the time the second and later threads are unblocked. Remember not to unlock the mutex prematurely.
@seealso(al_wait_cond_until) @seealso(al_broadcast_cond) @seealso(al_signal_cond)
#Allegro5.al_wait_cond_until
Like @link(al_wait_cond) but the call can return if the absolute time passes timeout before the condition is signalled.
@return(zero on success, non-zero if the call timed out.)
@seealso(al_wait_cond)
#Allegro5.al_broadcast_cond
Unblocks all threads currently waiting on a condition variable. That is, broadcast that some condition which those threads were waiting for has become true.

@bold(Note:) The pthreads spec says to lock the mutex associated with cond before signalling for predictable scheduling behaviour.
@seealso(al_signal_cond)
#Allegro5.al_signal_cond
Unblocks at least one thread waiting on a condition variable.

Generally you should use @link(al_broadcast_cond) but @code(al_signal_cond) may be more efficient when it’s applicable.
@seealso(al_broadcast_cond)



#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_TIMERptr
Pointer to timer.  This is an abstract data type representing a timer object.

#Allegro5.al_create_timer
Allocates and initializes a timer. The new timer is initially stopped.

Usage note:  typical granularity is on the order of microseconds, but with some drivers might only be milliseconds.
@param(speed_secs Seconds per "tick". Must be positive.)
@returns(If successful, a pointer to a new timer object, otherwise @nil.)
@seealso(al_start_timer) @seealso(al_destroy_timer)
#Allegro5.al_destroy_timer
Uninstalls the timer specified. If the timer is started, it will automatically be stopped before uninstallation. It will also automatically unregister the timer with any event queues.

Does nothing if passed the @nil pointer.
@seealso(al_create_timer)
#Allegro5.al_start_timer
Starts the timer specified.  From then, the timer's counter will increment at a constant rate, and it will begin generating events.  Starting a timer that is already started does nothing.  Starting a timer that was stopped will reset the timer's counter, effectively restarting the timer from the beginning.
@seealso(al_stop_timer) @seealso(al_get_timer_started) @seealso(al_resume_timer)
#Allegro5.al_stop_timer
Stops the timer specified. The timer's counter will stop incrementing and it will stop generating events. Stopping a timer that is already stopped does nothing.
@seealso(al_start_timer) @seealso(al_get_timer_started) @seealso(al_resume_timer)
#Allegro5.al_resume_timer
Resumes the timer specified. From then, the timer's counter will increment at a constant rate, and it will begin generating events. Resuming a timer that is already started does nothing. Resuming a stopped timer will not reset the timer's counter (unlike @link(al_start_timer)).
@seealso(al_start_timer) @seealso(al_stop_timer) @seealso(al_get_timer_started)
#Allegro5.al_get_timer_speed
Returns the timer's speed, in seconds. (The same value passed to @link(al_create_timer) or @link(al_set_timer_speed).)
@seealso(al_set_timer_speed)
#Allegro5.al_set_timer_speed
Sets the timer's speed, i.e. the rate at which its counter will be incremented when it is started. This can be done when the timer is started or stopped. If the timer is currently running, it is made to look as though the speed change occurred precisely at the last tick.
@param(speed_secs Exactly the same meaning as with @link(al_create_timer).)
@seealso(al_get_timer_speed)
#Allegro5.al_get_timer_count
Returns the timer's counter value. The timer can be started or stopped.
@seealso(al_set_timer_count)
#Allegro5.al_set_timer_count
Sets the timer's counter value. The timer can be started or stopped. The @code(count) value may be positive or negative, but will always be incremented by +1 at each tick.
@seealso(al_get_timer_count) @seealso(al_add_timer_count)
#Allegro5.al_add_timer_count
Add @code(diff) to the timer's counter value. This is similar to writing:
@longcode(!
al_set_timer_count (Timer, al_get_timer_count (Timer) + diff);
!)
except that the addition is performed atomically, so no ticks will be lost.
@seealso(al_set_timer_count)
#Allegro5.al_get_timer_event_source
Retrieves the associated event source. Timers will generate events of type @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_TIMER).



#Allegro5.ALLEGRO_STATE
Opaque type which is passed to @link(al_store_state)/@link(al_restore_state).

The various state kept internally by Allegro can be displayed like this:
@preformatted(
  global
      active system driver
          current config
  per thread
      new bitmap params
      new display params
      active file interface
      errno
      current blending mode
      current display
          deferred drawing
      current target bitmap
          current transformation
          current projection transformation
          current clipping rectangle
          bitmap locking
          current shader
)
In general, the only real global state is the active system driver. All other global state is per-thread, so if your application has multiple separate threads they never will interfere with each other. (Except if there are objects accessed by multiple threads of course. Usually you want to minimize that though and for the remaining cases use synchronization primitives described in the threads section or events described in the events section to control inter-thread communication.)

#Allegro5.al_store_state
Stores part of the state of the current thread in the given @link(ALLEGRO_STATE) object. The flags parameter can take any bit-combination of these flags:
@unorderedlist(
 @item(@code(ALLEGRO_STATE_NEW_DISPLAY_PARAMETERS) - new_display_format, new_display_refresh_rate, new_display_flags)
 @item(@code(ALLEGRO_STATE_NEW_BITMAP_PARAMETERS) - new_bitmap_format, new_bitmap_flags)
 @item(@code(ALLEGRO_STATE_DISPLAY) - current_display)
 @item(@code(ALLEGRO_STATE_TARGET_BITMAP) - target_bitmap)
 @item(@code(ALLEGRO_STATE_BLENDER) - blender)
 @item(@code(ALLEGRO_STATE_TRANSFORM) - current_transformation)
 @item(@code(ALLEGRO_STATE_PROJECTION_TRANSFORM) - current_projection_transformation)
 @item(@code(ALLEGRO_STATE_NEW_FILE_INTERFACE) - new_file_interface)
 @item(@code(ALLEGRO_STATE_BITMAP) - same as @code(ALLEGRO_STATE_NEW_BITMAP_PARAMETERS) and @code(ALLEGRO_STATE_TARGET_BITMAP))
 @item(@code(ALLEGRO_STATE_ALL) - all of the above)
)
@seealso(al_restore_state)
#Allegro5.al_restore_state
Restores part of the state of the current thread from the given @link(ALLEGRO_STATE) object.
@seealso(al_store_state)



#al5acodec.al_init_acodec_addon
This procedure registers all the known audio file type handlers for @link(al_load_sample), @link(al_save_sample), @link(al_load_audio_stream), etc.

Depending on what libraries are available, the full set of recognised extensions is: .wav, .flac, .ogg, .it, .mod, .s3m, .xm.

@italic(Limitations:)
@unorderedlist(
  @item(Saving is only supported for wav files.)
  @item(The wav file loader currently only supports 8/16 bit little endian PCM files. 16 bits are used when saving wav files. Use flac files if more precision is required.)
  @item(Module files @(.it, .mod, .s3m, .xm@) are often composed with streaming in mind, and sometimes cannot be easily rendered into a finite length sample. Therefore they cannot be loaded with @link(al_load_sample) and must be streamed with @link(al_load_audio_stream).)
  @item(.voc file streaming is unimplemented.)
)
@return(@true on success.)
#al5acodec.al_get_allegro_acodec_version
Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as @link(al_get_allegro_version).



#al5audio.ALLEGRO_EVENT_AUDIO_STREAM_FRAGMENT
Sent when a stream fragment is ready to be filled in. @seealso(al_get_audio_stream_fragment)
#al5audio.ALLEGRO_EVENT_AUDIO_RECORDER_FRAGMENT
Sent after a user-specified number of samples have been recorded. Convert this to @link(ALLEGRO_AUDIO_RECORDER_EVENT) via @link(al_get_audio_recorder_event).

You must always check the values for the buffer and samples as they are not guaranteed to be exactly what was originally specified.

@bold(Unstable API:) The API may need a slight redesign.

#al5audio.ALLEGRO_AUDIO_RECORDERptr
An opaque datatype that represents a recording device.

@bold(Unstable API:) The API may need a slight redesign.

#al5audio.ALLEGRO_AUDIO_RECORDER_EVENT
Structure that holds the audio recorder event data.

@bold(Unstable API:) The API may need a slight redesign.
@seealso(al_get_audio_recorder_event) @seealso(ALLEGRO_EVENT)

#al5audio.ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH
Sample depth and type as well as signedness. Mixers only use 32-bit signed float (-1..+1), or 16-bit signed integers. Signedness is determined by an "unsigned" bit-flag applied to the depth value.

@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_UINT8)): @code(INT8 + UNSIGNED)

#al5audio.ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE
@value(ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_ONCE the sample/stream is played from start to finish an then it stops.)
@value(ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_LOOP the sample/stream is played from start to finish (or between the two loop points). When it reaches the end, it restarts from the beginning.)
@value(ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_LOOP_ONCE just like ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_ONCE, but respects the loop end point.)
@value(ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_BIDIR the sample is played from start to finish (or between the two loop points). When it reaches the end, it reverses the playback direction and plays until it reaches the beginning when it reverses the direction back to normal. This is mode is rarely supported for streams.)


#al5audio.ALLEGRO_AUDIO_PAN_NONE
A special value for the pan property of sample instances and audio streams. Use this value to disable panning on sample instances and audio streams, and play them without attentuation implied by panning support.

@code(ALLEGRO_AUDIO_PAN_NONE) is different from a pan value of 0.0 (centered) because, when panning is enabled, we try to maintain a constant sound power level as a sample is panned from left to right. A sound coming out of one speaker should sound as loud as it does when split over two speakers. As a consequence, a sample with pan value 0.0 will be 3 dB softer than the original level.

(Please correct us if this is wrong.)

#al5audio.ALLEGRO_SAMPLEptr
Pointer to an Allegro sample object.

An Allegro sample object stores the data necessary for playing pre-defined digital audio. It holds a user-specified PCM data buffer and information about its format (data length, depth, frequency, channel configuration). You can have the same ALLEGRO_SAMPLE playing multiple times simultaneously.
@seealso(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCEptr)
#al5audio.ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID
An @code(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID) represents a sample being played via @link(al_play_sample). It can be used to later stop the sample with @link(al_stop_sample). The underlying @link(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCEptr) can be extracted using @link(al_lock_sample_id).
#al5audio.ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCEptr
Pointer to an Allegro sample instance.

An Allegro sample instance represents a playable instance of a predefined sound effect. It holds information about how the effect should be played: These playback parameters consist of the looping mode, loop start/end points, playing position, speed, gain, pan and the playmode. Whether a sample instance is currently playing or paused is also one of its properties.

An instance uses the data from an Allegro sample object. Multiple instances may be created from the same @code(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE). An @code(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE) must not be destroyed while there are instances which reference it.

To actually produce audio output, an @code(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCEptr) must be attached to an @link(ALLEGRO_MIXERptr) which eventually reaches an @link(ALLEGRO_VOICEptr) object.
@seealso(ALLEGRO_SAMPLEptr)
#al5audio.ALLEGRO_AUDIO_STREAMptr
Pointer to an @code(ALLEGRO_AUDIO_STREAM) object that is used to stream generated audio to the sound device, in real-time. This is done by reading from a buffer, which is split into a number of fragments. Whenever a fragment has finished playing, the user can refill it with new data.

As with @link(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCEptr) objects, streams store information necessary for playback, so you may not play the same stream multiple times simultaneously. Streams also need to be attached to an @link(ALLEGRO_MIXERptr), which, eventually, reaches an @link(ALLEGRO_VOICEptr) object.

While playing, you must periodically fill fragments with new audio data. To know when a new fragment is ready to be filled, you can either directly check with @link(al_get_available_audio_stream_fragments), or listen to events from the stream.

You can register an audio stream event source to an event queue; see @link(al_get_audio_stream_event_source). An @code(ALLEGRO_EVENT_AUDIO_STREAM_FRAGMENT) event is generated whenever a new fragment is ready. When you receive an event, use @link(al_get_audio_stream_fragment) to obtain a pointer to the fragment to be filled. The size and format are determined by the parameters passed to @link(al_create_audio_stream).

If you're late with supplying new data, the stream will be silent until new data is provided. You must call @link(al_drain_audio_stream) when you're finished with supplying data to the stream.

If the stream is created by @link(al_load_audio_stream) then it will also generate an @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_AUDIO_STREAM_FINISHED) event if it reaches the end of the file and is not set to loop.
#al5audio.ALLEGRO_MIXERptr
A mixer mixes together attached streams into a single buffer. In the process, it converts channel configurations, sample frequencies and audio depths of the attached sample instances and audio streams accordingly. You can control the quality of this conversion using @link(ALLEGRO_MIXER_QUALITY).

When going from mono to stereo (and above), the mixer reduces the volume of both channels by sqrt(2). When going from stereo (and above) to mono, the mixer reduces the volume of the left and right channels by sqrt(2) before adding them to the center channel (if present).
#al5audio.ALLEGRO_VOICEptr
A pointer to an Allegro voice.

A voice represents an audio device on the system, which may be a real device, or an abstract device provided by the operating system. To play back audio, you would attach a mixer, sample instance or audio stream to a voice.
@seealso(ALLEGRO_MIXERptr) @seealso(ALLEGRO_SAMPLEptr) @seealso(ALLEGRO_AUDIO_STREAMptr)

#al5audio.al_create_sample
Creates a sample data structure from the supplied buffer. If @code(free_buf) is @true then the buffer will be freed with @link(al_free) when the sample data structure is destroyed. For portability (especially Windows), the buffer should have been allocated with @link(al_malloc). Otherwise you should free the sample data yourself.

A sample that is referred to by the @code(samples) parameter refers to a sequence channel intensities. E.g. if you're making a stereo sample with the @code(samples) set to 4, then the layout of the data in buf will be:
@preformatted(
  LRLRLRLR
)
Where L and R are the intensities for the left and right channels respectively. A single sample, then, refers to the LR pair in this example.

To allocate a buffer of the correct size, you can use something like this:
@longcode(!
VAR
  SampleSize, Bytes: INTEGER;
  Buffer: POINTER;
BEGIN
  SampleSize := al_get_channel_count (ChanConf) * al_get_audio_depth_size (Depth);
  Bytes := Samples * SampleSize;
  Buffer := al_malloc (Bytes)
END.
!)
@seealso(al_destroy_sample) @seealso(ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH) @seealso(ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF)
#al5audio.al_destroy_sample
Frees the sample data structure. If it was created with the @code(free_buf) parameter set to @true, then the buffer will be freed with @link(al_free).

This function will stop any sample instances which may be playing the buffer referenced by the @code(ALLEGRO_SAMPLEptr).
@seealso(al_destroy_sample_instance) @seealso(al_stop_sample) @seealso(al_stop_samples)

#al5audio.al_create_sample_instance

#al5audio.al_set_sample
Changes the sample data that a sample instance plays. This can be quite an involved process.

First, the sample is stopped if it is not already.

Next, if data is @nil, the sample is detached from its parent (if any).

If data is not @nil, the sample may be detached and reattached to its parent (if any). This is not necessary if the old sample data and new sample data have the same frequency, depth and channel configuration. Reattaching may not always succeed.

On success, the sample remains stopped. The playback position and loop end points are reset to their default values. The loop mode remains unchanged.
@return(@true on success, @false on failure. On failure, the sample will be stopped and detached from its parent.)
@seealso(al_get_sample)
#al5audio.al_get_sample
Returns the sample data that the sample instance plays.

Note this returns a pointer to an internal structure, not the @link(ALLEGRO_SAMPLEptr) that you may have passed to @link(al_set_sample). However, the sample buffer of the returned @code(ALLEGRO_SAMPLEptr) will be the same as the one that was used to create the sample (passed to @link(al_create_sample)). You can use @link(al_get_sample_data) on the return value to retrieve and compare it.

#al5audio.al_stop_sample_instance
Stops an sample instance playing. @seealso(al_play_sample_instance)

#al5audio.al_create_audio_stream
Creates an @link(ALLEGRO_AUDIO_STREAMptr). The stream will be set to play by default. It will feed audio data from a buffer, which is split into a number of fragments.

A sample that is referred to by the @code(samples) parameter refers to a sequence channel intensities. E.g. if you're making a stereo stream with the @code(samples) set to 4, then the layout of the data in the fragment will be:
@preformatted(
  LRLRLRLR
)
Where L and R are the intensities for the left and right channels respectively. A single sample, then, refers to the LR pair in this example.

The choice of @code(buffer_count), @code(samples) and @code(freq) directly influences the audio delay. The delay in seconds can be expressed as:
@longcode(!
Delay := buffer_count * samples / freq
!)
This is only the delay due to Allegro's streaming, there may be additional delay caused by sound drivers and/or hardware.

@bold(Note)

If you know the fragment size in bytes, you can get the size in samples like this:
@longcode(!
  SampleSize := al_get_channel_count (ChannelConf) * al_get_audio_depth_size (Depth);
  Samples := BytesPerFragment / SampleSize;
!)
The size of the complete buffer is:
@longcode(!
  BufferSize := BytesPerFragment * buffer_count
!)
@bold(Note)

Unlike many Allegro objects, audio streams are not implicitly destroyed when Allegro is shut down. You must destroy them manually with al_destroy_audio_stream before the audio system is shut down.

@param(buffer_count How many fragments to use for the audio stream. Usually only two fragments are required - splitting the audio buffer in two halves. But it means that the only time when new data can be supplied is whenever one half has finished playing. When using many fragments, you usually will use fewer samples for one, so there always will be (small) fragments available to be filled with new data.)
@param(samples The size of a fragment in samples.)
@param(freq The frequency, in Hertz.)
@param(depth Must be one of the values listed for @link(ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH).)
@param(chan_conf Must be one of the values listed for @link(ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF).)
#al5audio.al_destroy_audio_stream
Destroys an audio stream which was created with @link(al_create_audio_stream) or @link(al_load_audio_stream).

@bold(Note)

If the stream is still attached to a mixer or voice, @link(al_detach_audio_stream) is automatically called on it first.
@seealso(al_drain_audio_stream)

#al5audio.al_get_audio_stream_fragment
When using Allegro's audio streaming, you will use this function to continuously provide new sample data to a stream.

If the stream is ready for new data, the function will return the address of an internal buffer to be filled with audio data. The length and format of the buffer are specified with @link(al_create_audio_stream) or can be queried with the various functions described here. Once the buffer is filled, you must signal this to Allegro by passing the buffer to @link(al_set_audio_stream_fragment).

If the stream is not ready for new data, the function will return @nil.

@bold(Note)

If you listen to events from the stream, an @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_AUDIO_STREAM_FRAGMENT) event will be generated whenever a new fragment is ready. However, getting an event is not a guarantee that @link(al_get_audio_stream_fragment) will not return @nil, so you still must check for it.

#al5audio.al_create_voice
Creates a voice structure and allocates a voice from the digital sound driver. The passed frequency (in HZ), sample format and channel configuration are used as a hint to what kind of data will be sent to the voice. However, the underlying sound driver is free to use non-matching values. For example, it may be the native format of the sound hardware.

If a mixer is attached to the voice, the mixer will handle the conversion of all its input streams to the voice format and care does not have to be taken for this. However if you access the voice directly, make sure to not rely on the parameters passed to this function, but instead query the returned voice for the actual settings.

Attaches a sample instance to a voice, and allows it to play. The instance's gain and loop mode will be ignored, and it must have the same frequency, channel configuration and depth (including signed-ness) as the voice. This function may fail if the selected driver doesn't support preloading sample data.

At this time, we don't recommend attaching sample instances directly to voices. Use a mixer inbetween.

#al5audio.al_lock_sample_id
Locks a @link(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID), returning the underlying @link(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCEptr). This allows you to adjust the various properties of the instance (such as volume, pan, etc) while the sound is playing.

This function will return @nil if the sound corresponding to the id is no longer playing.

While locked, @code(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID) will be unavailable to additional calls to @link(al_play_sample), even if the sound stops while locked. To put the @code(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID) back into the pool for reuse, make sure to call @link(al_unlock_sample_id) when you're done with the instance.

Tries to guess the audio file type of the open @link(ALLEGRO_FILEptr) by reading the first few bytes.  By default Allegro cannot recognize any file types, but calling @code(al_init_acodec_addon) will add detection of the types it can read.  You can also use @code(al_register_sample_identifier) to add identification for custom file types.

#al5audio.al_create_audio_recorder
Creates an audio recorder using the system's default recording device. (So if the returned device does not work, try updating the system's default recording device.)

Allegro will internally buffer several seconds of captured audio with minimal latency. (XXX: These settings need to be exposed via config or API calls.) Audio will be copied out of that private buffer into a fragment buffer of the size specified by the samples parameter. Whenever a new fragment is ready an event will be generated.

The total size of the fragment buffer is fragment_count * samples * bytes_per_sample. It is treated as a circular, never ending buffer. If you do not process the information fast enough, it will be overrun. Because of that, even if you only ever need to process one small fragment at a time, you should still use a large enough value for @code(fragment_count) to hold a few seconds of audio.

@code(frequency) is the number of samples per second to record. Common values are:
@unorderedlist(
  @item(8000 - telephone quality speech)
  @item(11025)
  @item(22050)
  @item(44100 - CD quality music @(if 16-bit, stereo@))
)
For maximum compatibility, use a depth of @code(ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_UINT8) or @link(ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_INT16), and a single (mono) channel.

The recorder will not record until you start it with @link(al_start_audio_recorder).

#al5audio.al_start_audio_recorder
Begin recording into the fragment buffer. Once a complete fragment has been captured (as specified in @link(al_create_audio_recorder)), an @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_AUDIO_RECORDER_FRAGMENT) event will be triggered.
@return(@true if it was able to begin recording.)

@bold(Unstable API:) The API may need a slight redesign.
@seealso(al_stop_audio_recorder) @seealso(al_get_audio_recorder_event_source)
#al5audio.al_stop_audio_recorder
Stop capturing audio data. Note that the audio recorder is still active and consuming resources, so if you are finished recording you should destroy it with @link(al_destroy_audio_recorder).

You may still receive a few events after you call this function as the device flushes the buffer.

If you restart the recorder, it will begin recording at the beginning of the next fragment buffer.

#al5audio.al_destroy_audio_recorder
Destroys the audio recorder and frees all resources associated with it. It is safe to destroy a recorder that is recording.

#al5color.al_color_distance_ciede2000
This function computes the CIEDE2000 color difference between two RGB colors. This is a visually uniform color difference, unlike for example the RGB distance.

When using the RGB distance (Euklidean distance between two RGB triplets) there can be color pairs with the same distance, where the colors of one pair appear to be almost the same color, while the colors of the other pair look quite different. This is improved by using the L*a*b* color space which was designed with perceptual uniformity in mind. However it still is not completely uniform. The CIEDE2000 formula contains some additional transformations to fix that.

The returned color distance is roughly in the range 0 (identical color) to 1 (completely different color) - but values greater than one are possible.

@bold(Note)

This function uses @link(al_color_lab) internally which defines the L component to be in the range @code(0..1) (and not @code(0..100) as is sometimes seen).

#al5color.al_color_lch
Returns an @link(ALLEGRO_COLOR) structure from CIE LCH values. LCH colors are very similar to HSL, with the same meaning of L and H and C corresponding to S. However LCH is more visually uniform. Furthermore, this function expects the angle for H in radians and not in degree.

The CIE LCH color space is a cylindrical representation of the L*a*b* color space. The L component is the same and C and H are computed like this:
@preformatted(
C = sqrt @(a * a + b * b@)
H = atan2 @(b, a@)
)

#al5color.al_is_color_valid
Checks if all components of the color are between 0 and 1. Some of the color conversions in this addon support color spaces with more colors than can be represented in sRGB and when converted to RGB will result in invalid color components outside the @code(0..1) range.

@seealso(al_color_linear) @seealso(al_color_linear_to_rgb)
#al5color.al_color_linear
Returns an @link(ALLEGRO_COLOR) structure from linear sRGB values. Allegro RGB values are assumed to be sRGB. The sRGB standard is in wide use by various display devices. It accounts for a standard gamma correction applied to RGB colors before they get displayed.

Gamma correction means if for example we have a medium gray color specified with @code(@link(al_map_rgb_f) @(0.5,0.5,0.5@)) then we do not want the monitor to set the pixel to exactly half the physical maximum intensity, but instead to an intensity that appears to be half as bright as the maximum to the person looking at it. In this case that would be closer to 21% of maximum intensity rather than to 50% intensity.

For some applications it may be useful to specify a color in linear sRGB components, in which case you can use this function. For example:
@longcode(#
var
  Gray: ALLEGRO_COLOR;
  Htm: String;
begin
  ...
  gray = al_color_linear (0.216, 0.216, 0.216);
  al_color_rgb_to_html (gray.r, gray.g, gray.b, html); { #808080 }
  ...
end.

#al5font.ALLEGRO_FONTptr
A handle identifying any kind of font. Usually you will create it with @link(al_load_font) which supports loading all kinds of TrueType fonts supported by the FreeType library. If you instead pass the filename of a bitmap file, it will be loaded with @link(al_load_bitmap) and a font in Allegro's bitmap font format will be created from it with @link(al_grab_font_from_bitmap).

#al5font.al_load_bitmap_font
Load a bitmap font from a file. This is done by first calling @link(al_load_bitmap_flags) and then @link(al_grab_font_from_bitmap).

If you wanted to load an old A4 font, for example, it would be better to load the bitmap yourself in order to call @link(al_convert_mask_to_alpha) on it before passing it to @link(al_grab_font_from_bitmap).
@seealso(al_load_bitmap_font_flags) @seealso(al_load_font) @seealso(al_load_bitmap_flags)
#al5font.al_load_bitmap_font_flags
Like @link(al_load_bitmap_font) but additionally takes a flags parameter.  The flags parameter is a bitfield containing a combination of the following:
@definitionlist(
@itemlabel(ALLEGRO_NO_PREMULTIPLIED_ALPHA) @item(The same meaning as for al_load_bitmap_flags.)
)
@seealso(al_load_bitmap_font) @seealso(al_load_bitmap_flags)
#al5font.al_load_font
Loads a font from disk. This will use @link(al_load_bitmap_font_flags) if you pass the name of a known bitmap format, or else @link(al_load_ttf_font).

The flags parameter is passed through to either of those functions. Bitmap and TTF fonts are also affected by the current bitmap flags at the time the font is loaded.
@seealso(al_destroy_font) @seealso(al_init_font_addon) @seealso(al_load_bitmap_font_flags) @seealso(al_load_ttf_font)

#al5font.al_grab_font_from_bitmap
Creates a new font from an Allegro bitmap. You can delete the bitmap after  the function returns as the font will contain a copy for itself.

The bitmap format is as in the following example, which contains three glyphs for 1, 2 and 3.
@preformatted(
.............
. 1 .222.333.
. 1 .  2.  3.
. 1 .222.333.
. 1 .2  .  3.
. 1 .222.333.
.............
)
In the above illustration, the dot is for pixels having the background color. It is determined by the color of the top left pixel in the bitmap. There should be a border of at least 1 pixel with this color to the bitmap edge and between all glyphs.

Each glyph is inside a rectangle of pixels not containing the background color. The height of all glyph rectangles should be the same, but the width can vary.

The placement of the rectangles does not matter, except that glyphs are scanned from left to right and top to bottom to match them to the specified unicode codepoints.

The glyphs will simply be drawn using @link(al_draw_bitmap), so usually you will want the rectangles filled with full transparency and the glyphs drawn in opaque white.

#al5font.al_create_builtin_font
Creates a monochrome bitmap font (8x8 pixels per character).

This font is primarily intended to be used for displaying information in environments or during early runtime states where no external font data is available or loaded (e.g. for debugging).

The builtin font contains the following unicode character ranges:

#al5font.al_draw_text
Writes the string @code(str) onto the target bitmap at position @code(x), @code(y), using the specified @code(font).

The flags parameter can be 0 or one of the following flags:@unorderedlist(

)
It can also be combined with this flag:@unorderedlist(
   @item(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_ALIGN_INTEGER)) - Always draw text aligned to an integer pixel position. This was formerly the default behaviour.)

The @code(diff) parameter is the maximum amount of horizontal space to allow between words. If justisfying the text would exceed diff pixels, or the string contains less than two words, then the string will be drawn left aligned.

The @code(flags) parameter can be 0 or one of the following flags:

#al5font.al_draw_glyph
Draws the glyph that corresponds with codepoint in the given color using the given font. If font does not have such a glyph, nothing will be drawn.

To draw a string as left to right horizontal text you will need to use @link(al_get_glyph_advance) to determine the position of each glyph. For drawing strings in other directions, such as top to down, use @link(al_get_glyph_dimensions) to determine the size and position of each glyph.

If you have to draw many glyphs at the same time, use @link(al_hold_bitmap_drawing) with @true as the parameter, before drawing the glyphs, and then call @link(al_hold_bitmap_drawing) again with @false as a parameter when done drawing the glyphs to further enhance performance.
@seealso(al_get_glyph_width) @seealso(al_get_glyph_dimensions) @seealso(al_get_glyph_advance)
#al5font.al_get_glyph_width

@seealso(al_draw_glyph) @seealso(al_get_glyph_dimensions) @seealso(al_get_glyph_advance)
#al5font.al_get_glyph_dimensions
Sometimes, the @link(al_get_glyph_width) or @link(al_get_glyph_advance) functions are not enough for exact glyph placement, so this function returns some additional information, particularly if you want to draw the font vertically.

The function itself returns @true if the character was present in font and @false if the character was not present in font.

Returned variables (all in pixel):@unorderedlist(
@item(@bold(bbx, bby) - Offset to upper left corner of bounding box.)
@item(@bold(bbw, bbh) - Dimensions of bounding box.)
)
These values are the same as @link(al_get_text_dimensions) would return for a string of a single character equal to the glyph passed to this function. Note that glyphs may go to the left and upwards of the X, in which case x and y will have negative values.

If you want to draw a string verticallly, for Japanese or as a game effect, then you should leave @code(bby + bbh) space between the glyphs in the y direction for a regular placement.

If you want to draw a string horizontally in an extra compact way, then you should leave @code(bbx + bbw) space between the glyphs in the x direction for a compact placement.

In the figure below is an example of what @code(bbx) and @code(bby) may be like for a @code(2) glyph, and a @code(g) glyph of the same font compared to the result of @code(al_get_glyph_width).

#al5font.al_get_glyph_advance
This function returns by how much the x position should be advanced for left to right text drawing when the glyph that corresponds to @code(codepoint1) has been drawn, and the glyph that corresponds to @code(codepoint2) will be the next to be drawn. This takes into consideration the horizontal advance width of the glyph that corresponds with @code(codepoint1) as well as the kerning between the glyphs of @code(codepoint1) and @code(codepoint2).

Kerning is the process of adjusting the spacing between glyphs in a font, to obtain a more visually pleasing result. Kerning adjusts the space between two individual glyphs with an offset determined by the author of the font.

If you pass @code(ALLEGRO_NO_KERNING) as @code(codepoint1) then @code(al_get_glyph_advance) will return @code(0). this can be useful when drawing the first character of a string in a loop.

Pass @code(ALLEGRO_NO_KERNING) as @code(codepoint2) to get the horizontal advance width of the glyph that corresponds to @code(codepoint1) without taking any kerning into consideration. This can be used, for example, when drawing the last character of a string in a loop.

This function will return zero if the glyph of @code(codepoint1) is not present in the font. If the glyph of @code(codepoint2) is not present in the font, the horizontal advance width of the glyph that corresponds to @code(codepoint1) without taking any kerning into consideration is returned.

When drawing a string one glyph at the time from the left to the right with kerning, the x position of the glyph should be incremented by the result of @code(al_get_glyph_advance) applied to the previous glyph drawn and the next glyph to draw.

Note that the return value of this function is a recommended advance for optimal readability for left to right text determined by the author of the font. However, if you like, you may want to draw the glyphs of the font narrower or wider to each other than what @code(al_get_glyph_advance) returns for style or effect.

In the figure below is an example of what the result of @code(al_get_glyph_advance) may be like for two glypphs @code(A) and @code(l) of the same font that has kerning for the @code("Al") pair, without and with the @code(ALLEGRO_NO_KERNING) flag.

#al5font.al_draw_multiline_text
Like @link(al_draw_text), but this function supports drawing multiple lines of text. It will break text in lines based on its contents and the max_width parameter. The lines are then layed out vertically depending on the @code(line_height) parameter and drawn each as if @link(al_draw_text) was called on them.

A newline @code(#10) in the text will cause a @italic("hard") line break after its occurrence in the string. The text after a hard break is placed on a new line. Carriage return @code(#12) is not supported, will not cause a line break, and will likely be drawn as a square or a space depending on the font.

The @code(max_width) parameter controls the maximum desired width of the lines. This function will try to introduce a @italic("soft") line break after the longest possible series of words that will fit in @code(max_length) when drawn with the given font. A @italic("soft") line break can occur either on a space or tab (@code(#7)) character.

However, it is possible that @code(max_width) is too small, or the words in text are too long to fit @code(max_width) when drawn with font. In that case, the word that is too wide will simply be drawn completely on a line by itself. If you don't want the text that overflows @code(max_width) to be visible, then use @link(al_set_clipping_rectangle) to clip it off and hide it.

The lines @code(str) was split into will each be drawn using the @code(font), @code(x), @code(color) and @code(flags) parameters, vertically starting at @code(y) and with a distance of @code(line_height) between them. If @code(line_height) is zero (@code(0)), the value returned by calling @link(al_get_font_line_height) on font will be used as a default instead.

The flags @code(ALLEGRO_ALIGN_LEFT), @code(ALLEGRO_ALIGN_CENTRE), @code(ALLEGRO_ALIGN_RIGHT) and @code(ALLEGRO_ALIGN_INTEGER) will be honoured by this function.

If you want to calculate the size of what this function will draw without actually drawing it, or if you need a complex and/or custom layout, you can use @link(al_do_multiline_text).
@seealso(al_do_multiline_text) @seealso(al_draw_multiline_ustr) @seealso(al_draw_multiline_textf)
#al5font.al_draw_multiline_textf

#al5font.al_do_multiline_text
This function processes the text and splits it into lines as @link(al_draw_multiline_text) would, and then calls the callback @code(cb) once for every line. This is useful for custom drawing of multiline text, or for calculating the size of multiline text ahead of time. See the documentation on @link(al_draw_multiline_text) for an explanation of the splitting algorithm.

For every line that this function splits text into the callback @code(cb) will be called once with the following parameters:
@unorderedlist(
  @item(@bold(@code(line_num)) - the number of the line starting from zero and counting up.)
  @item(@bold(@code(line)) - a pointer to the beginning character of the line @(see below@).)
  @item(@bold(@code(size)) - the size of the line @(0 for empty lines@).)
  @item(@bold(@code(extra)) - the same pointer that was passed to @code(al_do_multiline_text).)
)
Note that line is not guaranteed to be a @italic(NUL-terminated) string (i.e. @code(ANSISTRING)), but will merely point to a character within text or to an empty string in case of an empty line. If you need a @italic(NUL-terminated) string, you will have to copy line to a buffer and @italic(NUL-terminate) it yourself (TODO: Check if it is done by the compiler when using @code(ANSISTRING)). You will also have to make your own copy if you need the contents of line after @code(cb) has returned, as line is not guaranteed to be valid after that. Remember that in some cases @code(STRING) is @italic(reference-counted) by Pascal/Delphi.

If the callback @code(cb) returns @false, @code(al_do_multiline_text) will stop immediately, otherwise it will continue on to the next line.

Initializes the image addon. This registers bitmap format handlers for
@link(al_load_bitmap), @link(al_load_bitmap_f), @link(al_save_bitmap),
@link(al_save_bitmap_f).

The following types are built into the Allegro image addon and guaranteed to be
available: BMP, DDS, PCX, TGA. Every platform also supports JPEG and PNG via
external dependencies.

Other formats may be available depending on the operating system and installed
libraries, but are not guaranteed and should not be assumed to be universally
available.

The DDS format is only supported to load from, and only if the DDS file
contains textures compressed in the DXT1, DXT3 and DXT5 formats. Note that when
loading a DDS file, the created bitmap will always be a video bitmap and will
have the pixel format matching the format in the file.

Shuts down the image addon.  This is done automatically at program exit, but
can be called any time the user wishes as well.
@seealso(al_init_image_addon) @seealso(al_is_image_addon_initialized)
#al5image.al_get_allegro_image_version
Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as
@link(al_get_allegro_version).



#al5memfile.al_open_memfile
Returns a file handle to the block of memory. All read and write operations act upon the memory directly, so it must not be freed while the file remains open.

The mode can be any combination of @code('r') (readable) and @code('w') (writable). Regardless of the mode, the file always opens at position 0. The file size is fixed and cannot be expanded. The file is always read from/written to in binary mode, which means that no newline translation is performed.

It should be closed with @link(al_fclose). After the file is closed, you are responsible for freeing the memory (if needed).
#al5memfile.al_get_allegro_memfile_version
Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as @link(al_get_allegro_version).



#al5nativedlg.ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSERptr
Opaque handle to a native file dialog. @seealso(al_create_native_file_dialog)
#al5nativedlg.ALLEGRO_TEXTLOGptr
Opaque handle to a text log window. @seealso(al_open_native_text_log)
#al5nativedlg.ALLEGRO_MENUptr
An opaque data type that represents a menu that contains menu items. Each of the menu items may optionally include a sub-menu.
#al5nativedlg.ALLEGRO_MENUptrptr
Pointer to a @link(ALLEGRO_MENUptr) variable. @seealso(al_find_menu_item)
#al5nativedlg.ALLEGRO_MENU_INFO
A structure that defines how to create a complete menu system.

For items, these functions are helpful:
@preformatted(
ALLEGRO_ITEM_OF_MENU (caption, id, flags, icon)
ALLEGRO_MENU_SEPARATOR
ALLEGRO_END_OF_MENU
)
A well-defined menu will contain one or more menu items, and end with @link(ALLEGRO_END_OF_MENU). A menu may contain sub-menus.  An example:
@longcode(#
VAR
  MenuInfo: ARRAY [0..12] OF ALLEGRO_MENU_INFO;
  Menu: ALLEGRO_MENUptr;
BEGIN
  MenuInfo[ 0] := ALLEGRO_ITEM_OF_MENU ('&File->', 1);
  MenuInfo[ 1] :=   ALLEGRO_ITEM_OF_MENU ('&Open', 2, 0, NIL);
  MenuInfo[ 2] :=   ALLEGRO_ITEM_OF_MENU ('Open &Recent...->', 3);
  MenuInfo[ 3] :=     ALLEGRO_ITEM_OF_MENU ('Recent 1', 4, 0, NIL);
  MenuInfo[ 4] :=     ALLEGRO_ITEM_OF_MENU ('Recent 2', 5, 0, NIL);
  MenuInfo[ 5] :=     ALLEGRO_END_OF_MENU;
  MenuInfo[ 6] :=   ALLEGRO_MENU_SEPARATOR;
  MenuInfo[ 7] :=   ALLEGRO_ITEM_OF_MENU ('E&xit', 6, 0, NIL);
  MenuInfo[ 8] :=   ALLEGRO_END_OF_MENU;
  MenuInfo[ 9] := ALLEGRO_ITEM_OF_MENU ('&Help->', 7);
  MenuInfo[10] :=   ALLEGRO_ITEM_OF_MENU ('&About', 8, 0, NIL);
  MenuInfo[11] :=   ALLEGRO_END_OF_MENU;
  MenuInfo[12] := ALLEGRO_END_OF_MENU;

  Menu := al_build_menu (MenuInfo)
END;

#al5nativedlg.al_init_native_dialog_addon
Initializes the native dialog addon.

@bold(Note)

Prior to Allegro 5.1.0 native dialog functions could be called without explicit initialisation, but that is now deprecated. Future functionality may require explicit initialisation. An exception is @link(al_show_native_message_box), which may be useful to show an error message if Allegro fails to initialise.
@return(@true on success, @false on error.)
@seealso(al_shutdown_native_dialog_addon) @seealso(al_is_native_dialog_addon_initialized)
#al5nativedlg.al_is_native_dialog_addon_initialized

@seealso(al_init_native_dialog_addon) @seealso(al_shutdown_native_dialog_addon)
#al5nativedlg.al_shutdown_native_dialog_addon
Shuts down the native dialog addon. @seealso(al_init_native_dialog_addon) @seealso(al_is_native_dialog_addon_initialized)


#al5nativedlg.al_create_native_file_dialog
Creates a new native file dialog. You should only have one such dialog opened at a time.
@param(initial_path The initial search path and filename.  To start with a blank file name the string should end with a directory separator (this should be the common case).)
@param(title Title of the dialog.)
@param(patterns A list of semi-colon separated patterns to match. This should not contain any whitespace characters. If a pattern contains the '/' character, then it is treated as a MIME type (e.g. @code('image/png')). Not all platforms support file patterns. If the native dialog does not provide support, this parameter is ignored.)
@param(mode 0, or a combination (@code(OR)) of the following flags: @definitionlist(
  @itemlabel(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_FILE_MUST_EXIST))) @item(If supported by the native dialog, it will not allow entering new names, but just allow existing files to be selected. Else it is ignored.)
  @itemlabel(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_SAVE))) @item(If the native dialog system has a different dialog for saving @(for example one which allows creating new directories@), it is used. Else it is ignored.)
  @itemlabel(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_FOLDER))) @item(If there is support for a separate dialog to select a folder instead of a file, it will be used.)
  @itemlabel(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_PICTURES))) @item(If a different dialog is available for selecting pictures, it is used. Else it is ignored.)
  @itemlabel(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_SHOW_HIDDEN))) @item(If the platform supports it, also hidden files will be shown.)
  @itemlabel(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_MULTIPLE))) @item(If supported, allow selectingmultiple files.)
))
@Returns(A handle to the dialog which you can pass to @link(al_show_native_file_dialog) to display it, and from which youthen can query the results using @link(al_get_native_file_dialog_count) and @link(al_get_native_file_dialog_path). When you are done, call @link(al_destroy_native_file_dialog) on it.

If a dialog window could not be created then this function returns @nil.)
#al5nativedlg.al_show_native_file_dialog
Shows the dialog window. The display may be @nil, otherwise the given display is treated as the parent if possible.

This function blocks the calling thread until it returns, so you may want to spawn a thread and call it from inside that thread.
@return(@true on success, @false on failure.)
@seealso(al_create_native_file_dialog)
#al5nativedlg.al_get_native_file_dialog_count
Returns the number of files selected, or @code(0) if the dialog was cancelled.
@seealso(al_create_native_file_dialog) @seealso(al_show_native_file_dialog)
#al5nativedlg.al_get_native_file_dialog_path
Returns one of the selected paths with index @code(i). The index should range from @code(0) to the return value of @code(@link(al_get_native_file_dialog_count) (d) - 1).
@seealso(al_create_native_file_dialog) @seealso(al_show_native_file_dialog)

#al5nativedlg.al_show_native_message_box
Shows a native GUI message box.  This can be used for example to display an error message if creation of an initial display fails. The display may be @nil, otherwise the given display is treated as the parent if possible.

The message box will have a single "OK" button and use the style informative dialog boxes usually have on the native system. If the @code(buttons) parameter is not an empty string, you can instead specify the button text in a string, with buttons separated by a vertical bar (|).

@bold(Note) @code(buttons) parameter is currently unimplemented on Windows.

The flags available are: @definitionlist(
  @itemlabel(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_WARN))) @item(The message is a warning.  This may cause a different icon @(or other effects@).)
  @itemlabel(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_ERROR))) @item(The message is an error.)
  @itemlabel(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_QUESTION))) @item(The message is a question.)
  @itemlabel(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_OK_CANCEL))) @item(Display a cancel button alongside the "OK" button. Ignored if @code(buttons) is not an empty string.)
  @itemlabel(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_YES_NO))) @item(Display Yes/No buttons instead of the "OK" button. Ignored if @code(buttons) is not an empty string.)
)
@code(al_show_native_message_box) may be called without Allegro being installed. This is useful to report an error during initialisation of Allegro itself.

@bold(Example)
@longcode(#
Button := al_show_native_message_box (
  Display,
  'Warning',
  'Are you sure?',
  'If you click yes then you are confirming that "Yes" '+
  'is your response to the query which you have '+
  'generated by the action you took to open this '+
  'message box.',
  '',
  ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_YES_NO
);
CASE Button OF
1: { "Yes" pressed }
 ...
2: { "No" pressed }
 ...
ELSE { Error }
 ...
END;
#)
@return(
  @unorderedlist(
    @item(@code(@bold(0)) if the dialog window was closed without activating a button.)
    @item(@code(@bold(1)) if the OK or Yes button was pressed.)
    @item(@code(@bold(2)) if the Cancel or No button was pressed)
  )
  If @code(buttons) is not an empty string, the number of the pressed button is returned, starting with 1.

  If a message box could not be created then this returns 0, as if the window was dismissed without activating a button.
)

#al5nativedlg.al_open_native_text_log
Opens a window to which you can append log messages with @link(al_append_native_text_log).  This can be useful for debugging if you don't want to depend on a console being available.

Use @link(al_close_native_text_log) to close the window again.
@param(title Title of the dialog.)
@param(flags One of: @definitionlist(

@returns(@nil if there was an error opening the window, or if text log  windows are not implemented on the platform.)
@seealso(al_append_native_text_log) @seealso(al_close_native_text_log)
#al5nativedlg.al_close_native_text_log
Closes a message log window opened with @code(al_open_native_text_log) earlier.

Does nothing if passed @nil.
@seealso(al_open_native_text_log)
#al5nativedlg.al_append_native_text_log
Appends a line of text to the message log window and scrolls to the bottom (if the line would not be visible otherwise). A line is continued until you add a newline character.

If the window is @nil then this function will fall back to calling @code(Write). This makes it convenient to support logging to a window or a terminal.
#al5nativedlg.al_get_native_text_log_event_source
Gets an event source for a text log window. The possible events are:
@definitionlist(
  @itemlabel(@bold(@code(ALLEGRO_EVENT_NATIVE_DIALOG_CLOSE))) @item(The window was requested to be closed, either by pressing the close button or pressing Escape on the keyboard. The @code(user.data1) field will hold a pointer to the @code(ALLEGRO_TEXTLOG) which generated the event. The @code(user.data2) field will be @code(1) if the event was generated as a result of a key press; otherwise it will be zero.)

@return(@true on success.)
@seealso(al_append_menu_item) @seealso(al_remove_menu_item)
#al5nativedlg.al_remove_menu_item
Removes the specified item from the menu and destroys it.  If the item contains a sub-menu, it too is destroyed.  Any references to it are invalidated. If you want to preserve that sub-menu, you should first make a copy with @link(al_clone_menu).

This is safe to call on a menu that is currently being displayed.
@returns(@true if an item was removed.)
@seealso(al_append_menu_item) @seealso(al_insert_menu_item) @seealso(al_destroy_menu)
#al5nativedlg.al_clone_menu
Makes a copy of a menu so that it can be reused on another display.  The menu being cloned can be anything: a regular menu, a popup menu, or a sub-menu. @return(The cloned menu.)
@seealso(al_clone_menu_for_popup)
#al5nativedlg.al_clone_menu_for_popup
Exactly like @link(al_clone_menu), except that the copy is for a popup menu.
#al5nativedlg.al_destroy_menu
Destroys an entire menu, including its sub-menus. Any references to it or a sub-menu are no longer valid. It is safe to call this on a menu that is currently being displayed. @seealso(al_remove_menu_item)

#al5nativedlg.al_get_menu_item_caption
Returns the caption associated with the menu item.  It is valid as long as the caption is not modified.

Returns @nil if the item was not found.
@seealso(al_set_menu_item_caption)

#al5nativedlg.al_get_menu_item_icon
Returns the icon associated with the menu.  It is safe to draw to the returned bitmap, but you must call @link(al_set_menu_item_icon) in order for the changes to be applied.

Returns @nil if the item was not found or if it has no icon.
@seealso(al_set_menu_item_icon)
#al5nativedlg.al_set_menu_item_icon
Sets the icon for the specified menu item.  The menu assumes ownership of the @code(ALLEGRO_BITMAP) and may invalidate the pointer, so you must clone it if you wish to continue using it.

If a video bitmap is passed, it will automatically be converted to a memory bitmap, so it is preferrable to pass a memory bitmap.

@returns(The menu, if found. Otherwise returns @nil.)
@seealso(al_find_menu_item)
#al5nativedlg.al_find_menu_item
Searches in the @code(haystack) menu for an item with the given @code(id). (Note that this only represents a literal ID, and cannot be used as an index.)

If @code(menu) and @code(index) are not @nil, they will be set as the parent menu containing the item and the zero-based (positive) index of the item. (If the menu item was not found, then their values are undefined.)
@returns(@true if the menu item was found.)

Returns the menu associated with the @code(display), or @nil if it does not have a menu.
@seealso(al_set_display_menu)
#al5nativedlg.al_set_display_menu
Associates the @code(menu) with the @code(display) and shows it.  If there was a previous menu associated with the display, it will be destroyed.  If you don't want that to happen, you should first remove the menu with @link(al_remove_display_menu).

If the menu is already attached to a display, it will not be attached to the new display.  If @code(menu) is @nil, the current menu will still be destroyed.

@bold(Note)

Attaching a menu may cause the window as available to your application to be resized!  You should listen for a resize event, check how much space was lost, and resize the window accordingly if you want to maintain your window's prior size.
@return(@true if successful.)
@seealso(al_create_menu) @seealso(al_remove_display_menu)
#al5nativedlg.al_popup_menu
Displays a context menu next to the mouse cursor.  The menu must have been created with @link(al_create_popup_menu). It generates events just like a regular display menu does.  It is possible that the menu will be canceled without any selection being made.
@param(display Indicates which window the menu is associated with (when you process the menu click event), but does not actually affect where the menu is located on the screen.)
@return(@true if the context menu was displayed.)
@seealso(al_create_popup_menu)
#al5nativedlg.al_remove_display_menu
Detaches the menu associated with the display and returns it.  The menu can then be used on a different display.

If you simply want to destroy the active menu, you can call
@link(al_set_display_menu) with a @nil menu.
@seealso(al_set_display_menu)

#al5nativedlg.al_get_allegro_native_dialog_version
Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as @link(al_get_allegro_version).



#al5opengl.al_get_opengl_version
Returns the OpenGL or OpenGL ES version number of the client (the computer the program is running on), for the current display. "1.0" is returned as @code($01000000), "1.2.1" is returned as @code($01020100), and "1.2.2" as @code($01020200) ,etc.

A valid OpenGL context must exist for this function to work, which means you may not call it before @link(al_create_display).
@seealso(al_get_opengl_variant)
#al5opengl.al_have_opengl_extension
This function is a helper to determine whether an OpenGL extension is available on the given display or not.

@bold(Example)
@longcode(%
packedpixels := al_have_opengl_extension ('GL_EXT_packed_pixels');
%)
If @italic(packedpixels) is @true then you can safely use the constants related to the packed pixels extension.
@return(@true if the extension is available; @false otherwise.)
@seealso(al_get_opengl_proc_address)
#al5opengl.al_get_opengl_proc_address
Helper to get the address of an OpenGL symbol.

@bold(Example)

How to get the function @code(glMultiTexCoord3fARB) that comes with ARB's Multitexture extension:
@longcode(%
TYPE
{ Define the type of the function. }
  MULTI_TEX_FUNC: PROCEDURE (a: GLenum; b, c, d: GLfloat); CDECL;
VAR

BEGIN
{ get the address of the function. }
  glMultiTexCoord3fARB := MULTI_TEX_FUNC (al_get_opengl_proc_address ('glMultiTexCoord3fARB'))
END;
%)
If @code(glMultiTexCoord3fARB) is not @nil then it can be used as if it has been defined in the OpenGL core library.
@param(name The name of the symbol you want to link to.)
@return(A pointer to the symbol if available or @nil otherwise.)
@seealso(al_have_opengl_extension)
#al5opengl.al_get_opengl_texture
Returns the OpenGL texture id internally used by the given bitmap if it uses one, else @code(0).

@bold(Example)
@longcode(%
  Bitmap := al_load_bitmap ('my_texture.png');
  Texture := al_get_opengl_texture (Bitmap);
  IF texture <> NIL THEN glBindTexture (GL_TEXTURE_2D, Texture);
%)
#al5opengl.al_remove_opengl_fbo
Explicitly frees an OpenGL FBO created for a bitmap, if it has one. Usually you do not need to worry about freeing FBOs, unless you use al_get_opengl_fbo.

@seealso(al_get_opengl_fbo) @seealso(al_set_target_bitmap)
#al5opengl.al_get_opengl_fbo
Returns the OpenGL FBO id internally used by the given bitmap if it uses one, otherwise returns zero. No attempt will be made to create an FBO if the bitmap is not owned by the current display.

The FBO returned by this function will only be freed when the bitmap is destroyed, or if you call @link(al_remove_opengl_fbo) on the bitmap.

@bold(Note:) In Allegro 5.0.0 this function only returned an FBO which had previously been created by calling @link(al_set_target_bitmap). It would not attempt to create an FBO itself. This has since been changed.
@seealso(al_remove_opengl_fbo) @seealso(al_set_target_bitmap)
#al5opengl.al_get_opengl_texture_size
Retrieves the size of the texture used for the bitmap. This can be different from the bitmap size if OpenGL only supports power-of-two sizes or if it is a sub-bitmap.
@return(@true on success, @false on failure. Zero width and height are returned if the bitmap is not an OpenGL bitmap.)
@seealso(al_get_opengl_texture_position)
#al5opengl.al_get_opengl_texture_position
Returns the u/v coordinates for the top/left corner of the bitmap within the used texture, in pixels.
@seealso(al_get_opengl_texture_size)
#al5opengl.al_get_opengl_program_object
Returns the OpenGL program object associated with this shader, if the platform is @link(ALLEGRO_SHADER_GLSL). Otherwise, returns @code(0).
#al5opengl.al_set_current_opengl_context
Make the OpenGL context associated with the given display current for the calling thread. If there is a current target bitmap which belongs to a different OpenGL context, the target bitmap will be changed to @nil.

Normally you do not need to use this function, as the context will be made current when you call @link(al_set_target_bitmap) or @link(al_set_target_backbuffer). You might need it if you created an OpenGL "forward compatible" context. Then @link(al_get_backbuffer) only returns @nil, so it would not work to pass that to @link(al_set_target_bitmap).
#al5opengl.al_get_opengl_variant
Returns the variant or type of OpenGL used on the running platform. This function can be called before creating a display or setting properties for new displays. Possible values are:
@definitionlist(
@itemlabel(@code(@bold(ALLEGRO_DESKTOP_OPENGL))) @item(Regular OpenGL as seen on desktop/laptop computers.)
@itemlabel(@code(@bold(ALLEGRO_OPENGL_ES))) @item(Trimmed down version of OpenGL used on many small consumer electronic devices such as handheld (and sometimes full size) consoles.)

  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_TEX_COORD Texture coordinate information, can be stored only in @code(ALLEGRO_PRIM_FLOAT_2) and @code(ALLEGRO_PRIM_SHORT_2). These coordinates are normalized by the width and height of the texture, meaning that the bottom-right corner has texture coordinates of @code(@(1, 1@)).)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_TEX_COORD_PIXEL Texture coordinate information, can be stored only in @code(ALLEGRO_PRIM_FLOAT_2) and @code(ALLEGRO_PRIM_SHORT_2). These coordinates are measured in pixels.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_USER_ATTR A user specified attribute. You can use any storage for this attribute. You may have at most 10 of these that you can specify by adding an index to the identifier, e.g. the first user attribute is @code(ALLEGRO_PRIM_USER_ATTR), the second is @code(ALLEGRO_PRIM_USER_ATTR2) and so on.

    To access these custom attributes from GLSL shaders you need to declare attributes that follow this nomenclature: @code(user_attr_#) where @code(#) is the index of the attribute.

    To access these custom attributes from HLSL you need to declare a parameter with the following semantics: @code(TEXCOORD{# + 2}) where @code(#) is the index of the attribute. E.g. the first attribute can be accessed via TEXCOORD2, second via TEXCOORD3 and so on.)

#al5primitives.ALLEGRO_PRIM_STORAGE
Enumerates the types of storage an attribute of a custom vertex may be stored in. Many of these can only be used for @link(ALLEGRO_PRIM_USER_ATTR) attributes and can only be accessed via shaders. Usually no matter what the storage is specified the attribute gets converted to single precision floating point when the shader is run. Despite that, it may be advantageous to use more dense storage formats (e.g. @code(ALLEGRO_PRIM_NORMALIZED_UBYTE_4) instead of @code(ALLEGRO_PRIM_FLOAT_4)) when bandwidth (amount of memory sent to the GPU) is an issue but precision is not.
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_FLOAT_1 A single float.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_FLOAT_2 A doublet of floats.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_FLOAT_3 A triplet of floats.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_FLOAT_4 A quad of floats.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_SHORT_2 A doublet of shorts.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_SHORT_4 A quad of shorts.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_UBYTE_4 A quad of unsigned bytes.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_NORMALIZED_SHORT_2 A doublet of shorts. Before being sent to the shader, each component is divided by 32767. Each component of the resultant float doublet ranges between -1.0 and 1.0.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_NORMALIZED_SHORT_4 A quad of shorts. Before being sent to the shader, each component is divided by 32767. Each component of the resultant float quad ranges between -1.0 and 1.0.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_NORMALIZED_UBYTE_4 A quad of unsigned bytes. Before being sent to the shader, each component is divided by 255. Each component of the resultant float quad ranges between 0.0 and 1.0.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_NORMALIZED_USHORT_2 A doublet of unsigned shorts. Before being sent to the shader, each component is divided by 65535. Each component of the resultant float doublet ranges between 0.0 and 1.0.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_NORMALIZED_USHORT_4 A quad of unsigned shorts. Before being sent to the shader, each component is divided by 65535. Each component of the resultant float quad ranges between 0.0 and 1.0.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_HALF_FLOAT_2 A doublet of half-precision floats. Note that this storage format is not supported on all platforms. @link(al_create_vertex_decl) will return @nil if you use it on those platforms.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_HALF_FLOAT_4 A quad of half-precision floats. Note that this storage format is not supported on all platforms. @link(al_create_vertex_decl) will return @nil if you use it on those platforms.)

#al5primitives.ALLEGRO_PRIM_BUFFER_FLAGS
Flags to specify how to create a vertex or an index buffer.
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_BUFFER_STREAM Hints to the driver that the buffer is written to often, but used only a few times per frame.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_BUFFER_STATIC Hints to the driver that the buffer is written to once and is used often.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC Hints to the driver that the buffer is written to often and is used often.)
  @value(ALLEGRO_PRIM_BUFFER_READWRITE Specifies that you want to be able read from this buffer. By default this is disabled for performance. Some platforms (like OpenGL ES) do not support reading from vertex buffers, so if you pass this flag to @link(al_create_vertex_buffer) or @link(al_create_index_buffer) the call will fail.)

#al5primitives.ALLEGRO_VERTEX_CACHE_SIZE
Defines the size of the transformation vertex cache for the software renderer. If you pass less than this many vertices to the primitive rendering functions you will get a speed boost. This also defines the size of the cache vertex buffer, used for the high-level primitives. This corresponds to the maximum number of line segments that will be used to form them.

#al5primitives.ALLEGRO_VERTEX_ELEMENT
A small structure describing a certain element of a vertex. E.g. the position of the vertex, or its color. These structures are used by the @link(al_create_vertex_decl) function to create the vertex declaration. For that they generally occur in an array. The last element of such an array should have the @code(attribute) field equal to @code(0), to signify that it is the end of the array. Here is an example code that would create a declaration describing the @link(ALLEGRO_VERTEX) structure (passing this as vertex declaration to @link(al_draw_prim) would be identical to passing @nil):
@longcode(%

#al5primitives.al_calculate_arc
When @code(thickness <= 0) this function computes positions of num_points regularly spaced points on an elliptical arc. When @code(thickness > 0) this function computes two sets of points, obtained as follows: the first set is obtained by taking the points computed in the @code(thickness <= 0) case and shifting them by @code(thickness / 2) outward, in a direction perpendicular to the arc curve. The second set is the same, but shifted @code(thickness / 2) inward relative to the arc. The two sets of points are interleaved in the destination buffer (i.e. the first pair of points will be collinear with the arc center, the first point of the pair will be farther from the center than the second point; the next pair will also be collinear, but at a different angle and so on).

The destination buffer dest is interpreted as a set of regularly spaced pairs of floats, each pair holding the coordinates of the corresponding point on the arc. The two floats in the pair are adjacent, and the distance (in bytes) between the addresses of the first float in two successive pairs is @code(stride). For example, if you have a tightly packed array of floats with no spaces between pairs, then stride will be exactly @code(2 * sizeof (float)).

Example with @code(thickness <= 0):
@longcode(%
CONST
  NumPoints = 4;
VAR
  Points: ARRAY [0..NumPoints-1, 0..1] OF AL_FLOAT;

#al5primitives.al_draw_filled_polygon
Draw a filled, simple polygon. Simple means it does not have to be convex but must not be self-overlapping.

When the y-axis is facing downwards (the usual), the coordinates must be ordered anti-clockwise.
@param(vertices Interleaved array of (x, y) vertex coordinates.)
@param(color Color of the filled polygon.)
@seealso(al_draw_polygon) @seealso(al_draw_filled_polygon_with_holes)
#al5primitives.al_draw_filled_polygon_with_holes
Draws a filled simple polygon with zero or more other simple polygons subtracted from it - the holes. The holes cannot touch or intersect with the outline of the filled polygon.

All hole vertices must use the opposite order (clockwise with y down) of the polygon vertices. All hole vertices must be inside the main polygon and no hole may overlap the main polygon.

For example:
@longcode(%
VAR
  Vertices: ARRAY [0..13] OF AL_FLOAT = (
      0,   0, { Filled polygon, upper left corner. }
      0, 100, { Filled polygon, lower left corner. }

    100,   0, { Filled polygon, upper right corner. }
     10,  10, { Hole, upper left. }
     90,  10, { Hole, upper right. }

    4, { number of vertices for filled polygon. }
    3, { number of vertices for hole. }
    0  { terminator. }
  );
%)
There are 7 vertices: four for an outer square from (0, 0) to (100, 100) in anti-clockwise order, and three more for an inner triangle in clockwise order. The outer main polygon uses vertices 0 to 3 (inclusive) and the hole uses vertices 4 to 6 (inclusive).
@param(vertices Interleaved array of (x, y) vertex coordinates for each of the polygons, including holes.)
@param(vertex_counts Number of vertices for each polygon. The number of vertices in the filled polygon is given by @code(vertex_counts[0]) and must be at least three. Subsequent elements indicate the number of vertices in each hole. The array must be terminated with an element with value zero.)
@param(color Color of the filled polygon.)

@seealso(al_ustr_new) @seealso(al_ustr_new_from_buffer)
#al5strings.al_cstr
Gets a @code(AL_STRptr) pointer to the data in a string. This pointer will only be valid while the @code(ALLEGRO_USTR) object is not modified and not destroyed. The pointer may be passed to functions expecting C-style strings, with the following caveats:@unorderedlist(
  @item(@code(ALLEGRO_USTR)s are allowed to contain embedded @code(NUL) @(@code($00)@) bytes. That means @code(al_ustr_size @(u@)) and @code(Length @(al_cstr @(u@)@)) may not agree.)
  @item(An @code(ALLEGRO_USTR) may be created in such a way that it is not @code(NUL) terminated. A string which is dynamically allocated will always be @code(NUL) terminated, but a string which references the middle of another string or region of memory will not be @code(NUL) terminated.)
  @item(If the @code(ALLEGRO_USTR) references another string, the returned C string will point into the referenced string. Again, no @code(NUL) terminator will be added to the referenced string.)

#al5strings.al_ustr_to_buffer

@seealso(al_cstr) @seealso(al_cstr_dup)
#al5strings.al_cstr_dup
Creates a @code(NUL) (@code($00)) terminated copy of the string. Any embedded @code(NUL) bytes will still be presented in the returned string. The new string must eventually be freed with @code(al_free).

If an error occurs @nil is returned.

@seealso(al_ustr_dup_substr) @seealso(al_ustr_free)
#al5strings.al_ustr_dup_substr
Returns a new copy of a string, containing its contents in the byte interval @code([start_pos, end_pos@)). The new string will be @code(NUL) terminated and will need to be freed with @code(al_ustr_free).

If necessary, use @link(al_ustr_offset) to find the byte offsets for a given code point that you are interested in.
@seealso(al_ustr_dup) @seealso(al_ustr_free)

@bold(Note)

This is used because the way the C language works.  I didn't test
if Pascal do need this kind of stuff.  Future versions of Allegro.pas would not
include this function, so don't use it unless your really need to (and tell me
if you really need it to remove this warning from documentation).

#al5strings.al_ustr_empty_string
Returns a pointer to a static empty string. The string is read only and must not be freed.

#al5strings.al_ref_cstr
Creates a string that references the storage of a C-style string. The
information about the string (e.g. its size) is stored in the @code(info)
parameter. The string will not have any other storage allocated of its own,
so if you allocate the info structure on the stack then no explicit "free"
operation is required.

The string is valid until the underlying C string disappears.

Example:
@longcode(!
VAR
  Info: ALLEGRO_USTR_INFO;
  us: ALLEGRO_USTRptr;
BEGIN
  us := al_ref_cstr (Info, 'my string')
END;
!)
@seealso(al_ref_buffer) @seealso(al_ref_ustr)
#al5strings.al_ref_buffer
Creates a string that references the storage of an underlying buffer. The size of the buffer is given in bytes. You can use it to reference only part of a string or an arbitrary region of memory.

The string is valid while the underlying memory buffer is valid.
@seealso(al_ref_cstr) @seealso(al_ref_ustr)
#al5strings.al_ref_ustr
Creates a read-only string that references the storage of another @link(ALLEGRO_USTR) string. The information about the string (e.g. its size) is stored in the structure pointed to by the @code(info) parameter. The new string will not have any other storage allocated of its own, so if you allocate the info structure on the stack then no explicit "free" operation is required.

The referenced interval is @code([start_pos, end_pos@)). Both are byte offsets.

The string is valid until the underlying string is modified or destroyed.

If you need a range of code-points instead of bytes, use @link(al_ustr_offset) to find the byte offsets.

#al5strings.al_ustr_length
Returns the number of code points in the string. @seealso(al_ustr_size) @seealso(al_ustr_offset)
#al5strings.al_ustr_offset
Returns the byte offset (from the start of the string) of the code point at the specified @code(index) in the string. A zero index parameter will return the first character of the string. If @code(index) is negative, it counts backward from the end of the string, so an index of -1 will return an offset to the last code point.

If the @code(index) is past the end of the string, returns the offset of the end of the string.
@seealso(al_ustr_length)
#al5strings.al_ustr_next
Finds the byte offset of the next code point in string, beginning at
@code(aPos). @code(aPos) does not have to be at the beginning of a code point.

This function just looks for an appropriate byte; it doesn't check if found
offset is the beginning of a valid code point. If you are working with
possibly invalid UTF-8 strings then it could skip over some invalid bytes.
@return(@true on success, and @code(aPos) will be updated to the found
offset. Otherwise returns @false if @code(aPos) was already at the end of
the string, and @code(aPos) is unmodified.)
@seealso(al_ustr_prev)
#al5strings.al_ustr_prev
Finds the byte offset of the previous code point in string, before
@code(aPos). @code(aPos) does not have to be at the beginning of a code point.

This function just looks for an appropriate byte; it doesn't check if found
offset is the beginning of a valid code point. If you are working with
possibly invalid UTF-8 strings then it could skip over some invalid bytes.

Inserts a code point into @code(us) beginning at byte offset @code(aPos). @code(aPos) cannot be less than 0. If @code(aPos) is past the end of @code(us) then the space between the end of the string and @code(aPos) will be padded with @code(NUL) (@code('\0')) bytes.
@Return(The number of bytes inserted, or 0 on error.)
@seealso(al_ustr_offset) @seealso(al_ustr_remove_chr)

#al5strings.al_ustr_remove_chr
Removes the code point beginning at byte offset pos.

Use @link(al_ustr_offset) to find the byte offset for a code-points offset.
@Return(@true on success. If @code(apos) is out of range or @code(apos) is not the beginning of a valid code point, returns @false leaving the string unmodified.)

Returns @true if the two strings are equal. This function is more efficient than @link(al_ustr_compare) so is preferable if ordering is not important.
@seealso(al_ustr_compare)
#al5strings.al_ustr_compare
This function compares @code(us1) and @code(us2) by code point values.  It returns zero if the strings are equal, a positive number if @code(us1) comes after @code(us2), else a negative number.

This does not take into account locale-specific sorting rules. For that you will need to use another library.
@seealso(al_ustr_ncompare) @seealso(al_ustr_equal)

#al5ttf.al_get_allegro_ttf_version
Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as @link(al_get_allegro_version).

#al5ttf.al_load_ttf_font
Loads a TrueType font from a file using the FreeType library.  Quoting from the FreeType FAQ this means support for many different font formats:

@italic(TrueType, OpenType, Type1, CID, CFF, Windows FON/FNT, X11 PCF, and others)

The @code(size) parameter determines the size the font will be rendered at, specified in pixels. The standard font size is measured in @italic(units per EM), if you instead want to specify the size as the total height of glyphs in pixels, pass it as a negative value.

@bold(Note)

If you want to display text at multiple sizes, load the font multiple times with different size parameters.

The following flags are supported:
@unorderedlist(
  @item(@code(ALLEGRO_TTF_NO_KERNING) - Do not use any kerning even if the font file supports it.)
  @item(@code(ALLEGRO_TTF_MONOCHROME) - Load as a monochrome font @(which means no anti-aliasing of the font is done@).)
  @item(@code(ALLEGRO_TTF_NO_AUTOHINT) - Disable the Auto Hinter which is enabled by default in newer versions of FreeType.)
)

#al5ttf.al_load_ttf_font_f
Like @link(al_load_ttf_font), but the font is read from the file handle. The @code(filename) is only used to find possible additional files next to a font file.

@bold(Note)

The file handle is owned by the returned @code(ALLEGRO_FONTptr) object and must not be freed by the caller, as FreeType expects to be able to read from it at a later time.
#al5ttf.al_load_ttf_font_stretch
Like @link(al_load_ttf_font), except it takes separate width (@code(w)) and height (@code(h)) parameters instead of a single size parameter.

If the height is a positive value, and the width zero or positive, then font will be stretched according to those parameters. The width must not be negative if the height is positive.

As with @link(al_load_ttf_font), the height may be a negative value to specify the total height in pixels. Then the width must also be a negative value, or zero.
@return(@nil if the height is positive while width is negative, or if the height is negative while the width is positive.)

#al5ttf.al_load_ttf_font_stretch_f
Like @link(al_load_ttf_font_stretch), but the font is read from the file handle. The @code(filename) is only used to find possible additional files next to a font file.

@bold(Note)

The file handle is owned by the returned @code(ALLEGRO_FONTptr) object and must not be freed by the caller, as FreeType expects to be able to read from it at a later time.

#al5video.ALLEGRO_EVENT_VIDEO_FRAME_SHOW
This event is sent when it is time to show a new frame. Once you receive this event, you can draw the current frame (as returned by @link(al_get_video_frame)). @code(al_get_video_frame) will continue returning the same frame until the next @code(ALLEGRO_EVENT_VIDEO_FRAME_SHOW) is sent.

@code(user.data1) will contain a pointer to the video which generated the event.
#al5video.ALLEGRO_EVENT_VIDEO_FINISHED
This event is sent when the video is finished. Depending on the backend, it may be possible to seek to an earlier part of the video and set the video to play to resume playback.

@code(user.data1) will contain a pointer to the video which generated the event.
#al5video.ALLEGRO_VIDEO_POSITION_TYPE
Used with @link(al_get_video_position) to specify which position to retrieve. If these get out of sync, audio and video may be out of sync in the display of the video.
@value(ALLEGRO_VIDEO_POSITION_ACTUAL The amount of time the video has been playing. If the video has audio then this value can be ahead of ALLEGRO_VIDEO_POSITION_VIDEO_DECODE when video decoding lags.)
@value(ALLEGRO_VIDEO_POSITION_VIDEO_DECODE The amount of video that has been decoded. This may lag behind the "actual" and audio positions if decoding is slower than realtime.)
@value(ALLEGRO_VIDEO_POSITION_AUDIO_DECODE The amount of audio that has been decoded. This may be the same as ALLEGRO_VIDEO_POSITION_ACTUAL if audio decode is driving the position, which is common to keep audio and video in sync.)

#al5video.al_init_video_addon
Initializes the video addon.
#al5video.al_shutdown_video_addon
Shuts down the video addon. This is done automatically at program exit, but can be called any time the user wishes as well.
#al5video.al_get_allegro_video_version
Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as @link(al_get_allegro_version).

#al5video.al_open_video
Reads a video file. This does not start streaming yet but reads the meta info so you can query e.g. the size or audio rate.
@seealso(al_close_video) @seealso(al_start_video)
#al5video.al_close_video
Closes the video and frees all allocated resources. The video pointer is invalid after the function returns.
@seealso(al_open_video)
#al5video.al_start_video
Starts streaming the video from the beginning.
@seealso(al_open_video) @seealso(al_start_video_with_voice) @seealso(al_get_video_event_source) @seealso(al_set_voice_playing)
#al5video.al_start_video_with_voice
Like @link(al_start_video) but audio is routed to the provided voice.
#al5video.al_get_video_event_source
Gets an event source for the video. The possible events are @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_VIDEO_FRAME_SHOW) and @link(ALLEGRO_EVENT_VIDEO_FINISHED).
#al5video.al_set_video_playing
Paused or resumes playback.
@seealso(al_is_video_playing)
#al5video.al_is_video_playing
Returns @true if the video is currently playing.
#al5video.al_get_video_audio_rate
Returns the audio rate of the video, in Hz.
#al5video.al_get_video_fps
Returns the speed of the video in frames per second. Often this will not be an integer value.
#al5video.al_get_video_scaled_width
Returns the width with which the video frame should be drawn. Videos often do not use square pixels, so this will may return a value larger than the width of the frame bitmap.
@seealso(al_get_video_frame)
#al5video.al_get_video_scaled_height
Returns the height with which the video frame should be drawn. Videos often do not use square pixels, so this will may return a value larger than the height of the frame bitmap.
@seealso(al_get_video_frame)
#al5video.al_get_video_frame
Returns the current video frame. The bitmap is owned by the video so do not attempt to free it. The bitmap will stay valid until the next call to @code(al_get_video_frame).

Videos often do not use square pixels so the recommended way to draw a video frame would be using code like this:
@longcode(%
CONST
  Scale: 1.0; { Adjust this to fit your target bitmap dimensions. }
VAR
  Frame: ALLEGRO_BITMAPptr;
  sw, sh, dw, dh: REAL;
BEGIN
  frame = al_get_video_frame (Video);
  sw = al_get_bitmap_width (Frame);
  sh = al_get_bitmap_height (Frame);
  dw = Scale * al_get_video_scaled_width (Video);
  dh = Scale * al_get_video_scaled_height (Video);
  al_draw_scaled_bitmap (Frame, 0, 0, sw, sh, 0, 0, dw, dh, 0);
END;
%)

#al5video.al_get_video_position
Returns the current position of the video stream in seconds since the beginning. The parameter is one of the @link(ALLEGRO_VIDEO_POSITION_TYPE) constants.
#al5video.al_seek_video
Seeks to a different position in the video. Currently only seeking to the beginning of the video is supported.
