@section(1 threads Threads)
Allegro includes a simple cross-platform threading interfaces but unfortunatelly @bold(it doesn't work with Pascal).

Anyway Free Pascal and Delphi threading interface and their @code(TThread) class work perfectly so use it.  See examples @code(ex_threads) and @code(ex_threads2) to know how to use them.

Note that documentation may include the description of the Allegro's threading interfaces but code was disabled.
