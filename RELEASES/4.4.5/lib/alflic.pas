UNIT alFlic;
(*<FLIC movie routines.

  There are two high level functions for playing FLI/FLC animations:
  @link(al_play_fli), which reads the data directly from disk, and
  @link(al_play_memory_fli), which uses data that has already been loaded into
  RAM.  Apart from the different sources of the data, these two functions
  behave identically.  They draw the animation onto the specified bitmap, which
  should normally be the screen.  Frames will be aligned with the top left
  corner of the bitmap:  if you want to position them somewhere else you will
  need to create a sub-bitmap for the FLI player to draw onto.

  If the callback function is not @nil it will be called once for each frame,
  allowing you to perform background tasks of your own.  This callback should
  normally return zero:  if it returns non-zero the player will terminate (this
  is the only way to stop an animation that is playing in looped mode).

  The FLI player returns @code(AL_FLI_OK) if it reached the end of the file,
  @code(AL_FLI_ERROR) if something went wrong, and the value returned by the
  callback function if that was what stopped it.  If you need to distinguish
  between different return values, your callback should return positive
  integers, since @code(AL_FLI_OK) is zero and @code(AL_FLI_ERROR) is negative.

  Note that the FLI player will only work when the timer module is installed,
  and that it will alter the palette according to whatever palette data is
  present in the animation file.

  Occasionally you may need more detailed control over how an FLI is played,
  for example if you want to superimpose a text scroller on top of the
  animation, or to play it back at a different speed.  You could do both of
  these with the lower level functions described below. *)

(* Plays an Autodesk Animator FLI or FLC animation on the specified
   @link(AL_BITMAP), reading the data from a copy of the file which is held in
   memory.  You can obtain the @code(fli_data) pointer by allocating a block
   of memory and reading an FLI file into it, or by importing an FLI into a
   grabber datafile.  If @code(loop) is @true, the player will cycle when it
   reaches the end of the file, otherwise it will play through the animation
   once and then return.  Read the introduction for @link(alflic) unit for a
   description of the @code(callback) parameter.

   Playing animations from memory is obviously faster than cuing them directly
   from disk, and is particularly useful with short, looped FLI's.  Animations
   can easily get very large, though, so in most cases you will probably be
   better just using @link(al_play_fli).  You can think of this function as a
   wrapper on top of @link(al_open_memory_fli), @link(al_next_fli_frame) and
   @link(al_close_fli).
