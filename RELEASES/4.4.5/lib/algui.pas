(*<GUI routines

  Allegro contains an object-oriented dialog manager, which was originally
  based on the Atari GEM system (@code(form_do()), @code(objc_draw()), etc: old
  ST programmers will know what we are talking about :-)  You can use the GUI
  as-is to knock out simple interfaces for things like the test program and
  setup utility, or you can use it as a basis for more complicated systems of
  your own.  Allegro lets you define your own object types by writing new
  dialog procedures, so you can take complete control over the visual aspects
  of the interface while still using Allegro to handle input from the mouse,
  keyboard, joystick, etc.

  A GUI dialog is stored as an array of @link(AL_DIALOG) objects.  The array
  should end with an object which has the proc pointer set to @nil.  Each
  object has a flags field which may contain any combination of the bit flags:
  @unorderedList(
    @item(@bold(AL_D_EXIT) - this object should close the dialog when it is
      clicked)
    @item(@bold(AL_D_SELECTED) - this object is selected)
    @item(@bold(AL_D_GOTFOCUS) - this object has got the input focus)
    @item(@bold(AL_D_GOTMOUSE) - the mouse is currently on top of this object)
    @item(@bold(AL_D_HIDDEN) - this object is hidden and inactive)
    @item(@bold(AL_D_DISABLED) - this object is greyed-out and inactive)
    @item(@bold(AL_D_DIRTY) - this object needs to be redrawn)
    @item(@bold(AL_D_INTERNAL) - don't use this! It is for internal use by the
      library...)
    @item(@bold(AL_D_USER) - any powers of two above this are free for your
      own use)
  )

  Each object is controlled by a dialog procedure, which is stored in the
  @code(proc) pointer.  This will be called by the dialog manager whenever any
  action concerning the object is required, or you can call it directly with
  the @link(al_object_message) function.  The dialog procedure should follow
  the form:
@longcode(#
  FUNCTION foo (msg: AL_INT; d: AL_DIALOGptr; c: AL_INT): AL_INT;
#)
  It will be passed a flag (msg) indicating what action it should perform, a
  pointer to the object concerned (d), and if msg is @code(AL_MSG_CHAR) or
  @code(AL_MSG_XCHAR), the key that was pressed (c).

  The dialog procedure should return one of the values:
  @unorderedList(
    @item(@bold(AL_D_O_K) - normal return status)
    @item(@bold(AL_D_CLOSE) - tells the dialog manager to close the dialog)
    @item(@bold(AL_D_REDRAW) - tells the dialog manager to redraw the entire
      dialog)
    @item(@bold(AL_D_REDRAWME) - tells the dialog manager to redraw the current
      object)
    @item(@bold(AL_D_WANTFOCUS) - requests that the input focus be given to this
      object)
    @item(@bold(AL_D_USED_CHAR) - MSG_CHAR and MSG_XCHAR return this if they used
      the key)
  )

  Dialog procedures may be called with any of the messages:
  @definitionList(
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_START)
    @item(Tells the object to initialise itself.  The dialog manager sends this
      to all the objects in a dialog just before it displays the dialog.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_END)
    @item(Sent to all objects when closing a dialog, allowing them to perform
      whatever cleanup operations they require.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_DRAW)
    @item(Tells the object to draw itself onto the screen.  The mouse pointer
      will be turned off when this message is sent, so the drawing code does
      not need to worry about it.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_CLICK)
    @item(Informs the object that a mouse button has been clicked while the
      mouse was on top of the object.  Typically an object will perform its own
      mouse tracking as long as the button is held down, and only return from
      this message handler when it is released.

      If you process this message, use the functions @code(al_gui_mouse_* ) to
      read the state of the mouse.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_DCLICK)
    @item(Sent when the user double-clicks on an object.  A @code(AL_MSG_CLICK)
      will be sent when the button is first pressed, then @code(AL_MSG_DCLICK)
      if it is released and pressed again within a short space of time.

      If you process this message, use the functions @code(al_gui_mouse_* ) to
      read the state of the mouse.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_KEY)
    @item(Sent when the keyboard shortcut for the object is pressed, or if
      enter, space, or a joystick button is pressed while it has the input
      focus.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_CHAR)
    @item(When a key is pressed, this message is sent to the object that has
      the input focus, with a @link(al_readkey) format character code (ASCII
      value in the low byte, scancode in the high byte) as the @code(c)
      parameter.  If the object deals with the keypress it should return
      @code(AL_D_USED_CHAR), otherwise it should return @code(AL_D_O_K) to
      allow the default keyboard interface to operate.  If you need to access
      Unicode character input, you should use @code(AL_MSG_UCHAR) instead of
      @code(AL_MSG_CHAR).)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_UCHAR)
    @item(If an object ignores the @code(AL_MSG_CHAR) input, this message will
      be sent immediately after it, passed the full Unicode key value as the
      @code(c) parameter.  This enables you to read character codes greater
      than 255, but cannot tell you anything about the scancode:  if you need
      to know that, use @code(AL_MSG_CHAR) instead.  This handler should return
      @code(AL_D_USED_CHAR) if it processed the input, or @code(AL_D_O_K)
      otherwise.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_XCHAR)
    @item(When a key is pressed, Allegro will send a @code(AL_MSG_CHAR) and
      @code(AL_MSG_UCHAR) to the object with the input focus.  If this object
      doesn't process the key @(ie. it returns @code(AL_D_O_K) rather than
      @code(AL_D_USED_CHAR)@), the dialog manager will look for an object with
      a matching keyboard shortcut in the key field, and send it a
      @code(AL_MSG_KEY).  If this fails, it broadcasts a @code(AL_MSG_XCHAR) to
      all objects in the dialog, allowing them to respond to special keypresses
      even when they don't have the input focus.  Normally you should ignore
      this message @(return @code(AL_D_O_K) rather than
      @code(AL_D_USED_CHAR)@), in which case Allegro will perform default
      actions such as moving the focus in response to the arrow keys and
      closing the dialog if @code(Esc) is pressed.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_WANTFOCUS)
    @item(Queries whether an object is willing to accept the input focus.  It
      should return @code(AL_D_WANTFOCUS) if it does, or @code(AL_D_O_K) if it
      isn't interested in getting user input.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_GOTFOCUS, AL_MSG_LOSTFOCUS)
    @item(Sent whenever an object gains or loses the input focus.  These
      messages will always be followed by a @code(AL_MSG_DRAW), to let objects
      display themselves differently when they have the input focus.  If you
      return @code(AL_D_WANTFOCUS) in response to a @code(AL_MSG_LOSTFOCUS)
      event, this will prevent your object from losing the focus when the mouse
      moves off it onto the screen background or some inert object, so it will
      only lose the input focus when some other object is ready to take over
      the focus @(this trick is used by the @link(al_d_edit_proc) object@).)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_GOTMOUSE, ALMSG_LOSTMOUSE)
    @item(Sent when the mouse moves on top of or away from an object.  Unlike
      the focus messages, these are not followed by a @code(AL_MSG_DRAW), so if
      the object is displayed differently when the mouse is on top of it, it is
      responsible for redrawing itself in response to these messages.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_IDLE)
    @item(Sent whenever the dialog manager has nothing better to do.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_RADIO)
    @item(Sent by radio button objects to deselect other buttons in the same
      group when they are clicked.  The group number is passed in the @code(c)
      message parameter.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_WHEEL)
    @item(Sent to the focused object whenever the mouse wheel moves.  The
      @code(c) message parameter contains the number of clicks.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_LPRESS, AL_MSG_MPRESS, AL_MSG_RPRESS)
    @item(Sent when the corresponding mouse button is pressed.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_LRELEASE, AL_MSG_MRELEASE, AL_MSG_RRELEASE)
    @item(Sent when the corresponding mouse button is released.)
    @itemlabel(AL_MSG_USER)
    @item(The first free message value. Any numbers from here on
      @(@code(AL_MSG_USER, AL_MSG_USER+1, AL_MSG_USER+2, ... AL_MSG_USER+n)@)
      are free to use for whatever you like.)
    )

  Allegro provides several standard dialog procedures.  You can use these as
  they are to provide simple user interface objects, or you can call them from
  within your own dialog procedures, resulting in a kind of OOP inheritance.
  For instance, you could make an object which calls @code(al_d_button_proc) to
  draw itself, but handles the click message in a different way, or an object
  which calls @code(al_d_button_proc) for everything except drawing itself, so
  it would behave like a normal button but could look completely different.

  Popup or pulldown menus are created as an array of @link(AL_MENU) structures.
  Each menu item contains a text string.  This can use the @code('&') character
  to indicate keyboard shortcuts, or can be an zero-length string to display
  the item as a non-selectable splitter bar.  If the string contains a
  @code(tab) character, any text after this will be right-justified, eg. for
  displaying keyboard shortcut information.  The @code(proc) field of
  @code(AL_MENU) is a function which will be called when the menu item is
  selected, and @code(child) points to another menu, allowing you to create
  nested menus.  Both @code(proc) and @code(child) may be @nil.  The
  @code(proc) function returns an integer which is ignored if the menu was
  brought up by calling @link(al_do_menu), but which is passed back to the
  dialog manager if it was created by a @link(al_d_menu_proc) object.  The
  array of menu items is terminated by an entry with a @nil text pointer.

  Menu items can be disabled (greyed-out) by setting the @code(AL_D_DISABLED)
  bit in the @code(flags) field, and a check mark can be displayed next to them
  by setting the @code(AL_D_SELECTED) bit.  With the default alignment and font
  this will usually overlap the menu text, so if you are going to use checked
  menu items it would be a good idea to prefix all your options with a space or
  two, to ensure there is room for the check. *)

   to select the color depth as well as the resolution and hardware driver.
   @code(filter) will be passed (card, w, h, color_depth) quadruplets and must
   return 0 to let the specified quadruplet be added to the list of displayed
   modes.

   As with @code(al_gfx_mode_select), the values stored at the addresses passed
   to the function will be used as suggestions for the initial selections in
   the dialog, defaulting to the first entry in each list if the values are not
   found.  Initialize the data stored at the addresses passed to the function to
   the value of 0 or -1 if you want to ensure that the initial selection for
   each list will be the first entry.

   If the dialog is OK'd, it stores the selections at the addresses passed to
   the function.

   Example usage:
@longcode(#
  ret := al_gfx_mode_select_filter (card, w, h, color_depth, @user_filter);
  IF ret THEN
  BEGIN
  // User okayed dialog or user_filter removed all modes
    IF card = AL_GFX_NONE THEN
    BEGIN
    // No modes available
      card := AL_GFX_TEXT; // Make sure not to leave card = AL_GFX_NONE
      EXIT (-1);
    END;
    // Handle changing to new mode here...
  END
  ELSE BEGIN
  // User cancelled dialog or there was an error (unlikely)
    IF card = AL_GFX_NONE THEN
    BEGIN
    // Error, probably out of memory
      card := AL_GFX_TEXT; // Make sure not to leave card = AL_GFX_NONE
      EXIT (-2);
    END;
  // Carry on in current graphics mode if that is acceptable
  END;
#)
    @return(@false if the user cancelled the dialog or an error occurred. In
      the case of an error then @code(card) is assigned the value
      @code(AL_GFX_NONE). The functions return @false if the user made a
      selection @bold(or) if all the modes were filtered out. In the case that
      all of the modes were filtered out, then @code(card) is assigned the value
      @code(AL_GFX_NONE). This means you should @bold(not) initialize the
      @code(card) to the value of @code(AL_GFX_NONE), as it could interfere with
      determining the proper return value.
