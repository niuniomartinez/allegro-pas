  OGG Vorbis Loading implemented by RPG Hacker http://www.rpg-hacker.de/

  This add-on allows to load an OGG/Vorbis sound file as an AL_SAMPLE object.

  You'll need all unit in the "lib" directory, but the Allegro.pas interface
  is in al_ogg.pas.  The "win32" directory contains DLL files needed.
