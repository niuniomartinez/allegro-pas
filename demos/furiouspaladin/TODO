 * A more modular design should be better.
 * May be a more OOP design (convert RECORDs in to CLASSes? Create zombie and
   player objects?)
 * It doesn't check data loading!!!  If it fails it just throws an Access
   Violation exception.
 * There are some issues with sound (Lazarus 1.6 + Xubuntu 16.4).
 * It is better to group graphics. i.e. put all graphics of zombie/player in
   a simple bitmap.  (Creating a bitmap manager class/object will help).
