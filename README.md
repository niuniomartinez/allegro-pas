# Allegro.pas
Wrapper to use [the Allegro game library](https://liballeg.org/) with Pascal compilers as [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/) and [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi).

Note that the official Allegro.pas wrapper is hosted at SourceForge: http://allegro-pas.sf.net/.  I'll try to keep this GitHub project synchronized with the official one so those who want to fork it will be able to keep their branches up-to-date with the latest commits (as possible).

You can download the packages from the [downloads page](http://allegro-pas.sf.net/downloads.php).  Don't forget to read the included `README` file.

If you're looking for online documentation, [follow this link](http://allegro-pas.sf.net/docs/).  You can build the documentation by yourself from sources using [pasdoc](https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc).
