     : Fixed al_load_audio_stream_f buffer_count declaration:  it was AL_STR.



Changes between versions 5.2.beta and 5.2.b.1
=============================================

  Goals where:
  - Complete the Allegro core (almost completed).
  - Complete the documentation (accomplished).
  - Recover Delphi compatibility (accomplished).

  Note that some backwards compatibility has been lost because the Delphi
  compatibility.



  Bugfixing
  ---------
  #15: ex_projection fixed modifying the way it gets stars position.
  #18: Now it doesn't use the "debug" version of the library by default, as it
       is not necessary and makes things not to work on Ubuntu unless you know
       what's happening (read build documentation).
     : Fixed constant name: ALLEGRO_RENDER_GREATER_EQUAL.
  #19: Fixed "Warning: Converting pointers to signed integers" in ex_menu by
       adding and using a new data structure (AL_DATA_PTR_T).
       See ALLEGRO_USER_EVENT in "API changes".

  ----
     : Added unit al5memfile.
     : Added unit al5video.
     : Added unit al5strings, and moved UTF8 stuff to it.
     : Added constant AL_EOF.
     : Added unstable API stuff, as it's quite useful.  This affects several
       units and subsystems.
  #16: Now Windows compiles for "monolith" by default.  You can define
       NO_MONOLITH to compile with the normal dynamic library.
     : Added a "resources" directory with some interesting resources.
     : Added some new constants with version information.
     : Added constant with TAU number (2PI).  Look for "Tau Manifesto" for more
       information.
     : Added display procedures al_set_new_display_refresh_rate,
       al_get_new_display_refresh_rate and al_apply_window_constraints.
     : Added color manipulation procedures for XYZ, L*a*b, xyY and LCH color
       spaces.
     : Added configuration procedures al_merge_config and al_merge_config_into.
     : Added formatting text procedures, glyph functions and more to al5font.
     : Added functions al_load_ttf_font_f and al_load_ttf_font_stretch_f to the
       al5ttf add-on.
     : Added UNICODE functions al_ustr_remove_chr, al_ustr_insert_chr and
       al_utf8_width.
     : Added al_transform_coordintates_4d and
       al_transform_coordintates_3d_projective.
     : Added function al_get_system_config.
     : Added audio functions al_get_audio_stream_played_samples, al_register_*.
     : Added OpenGL function al_get_opengl_program_object.

  API changes
  -----------
     : "Even wait" procedures now expects a pointer to the event variable
       instead of an "OUT" parameter.  This is because "OUT" parameters doesn't
       allows NIL parameters, and it is useful in such functions.
     : Parameter ident of al_load_bitmap_f is AL_STR now, wich is more
       coherent with other procedures.
     : Fixed parameter ident of al_load_bitmap_flags_f and
       al_save_bitmap_flags_f behavior.
     : Changed the name "_type" to "ftype" (i.e. "field type") and "_repeat" to
       "frepeat" on several RECORDs.
     : Removed procedure al_toggle_display_flag.  Actually don't know when and
       why was it removed from Allegro.
     : Removed procedures to iterate through INI files.  Use TIniFile class
       instead if needed.
     : Removed ALLEGRO_MONITOR_INFOptr type.
     : Changed parameters of al_transform_coordintates and
       al_transform_coordintates_3d from OUT to VAR.
     : Changed return type of al_check_inverse from AL_INT to AL_BOOL.
     : Removed ALLEGRO_SYSTEM stuff as it is for internal use only.  If needed,
       implement it as add-on.
     : Changed some functions and procedures of the al5primitives unit, using
       arrays instead of pointers, and using enumerations instead of integers.
  #18: Changed ALLEGRO_USER_EVENT declaration.  Now "data*" fields are
       AL_DATA_PTR_T, an union that allows to use them as POINTER or INTEGER.
       See Bug #18.
