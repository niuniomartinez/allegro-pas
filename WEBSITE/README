  This directory stores the website sources.  This way there's a copy available
  in any moment to check it.

  The website is distributed in sections:

  * Main section:  In the root of website, it uses a custom framework I created
    for my personal use, that's why some function and variable names are in
    spanish.  It just retrieves news from SourceForge, links files to download,
    and tells user where is everything else.

  * The Allegro.pas documentation:  That's build by the pasdoc utility using
    Allegro.pas' sources.  It's not included here.

  * The wiki:  It uses DokuWiki (http://dokuwiki.org/).  Note that here you'll
    find *only* templates, graphics and styles, not content nor DokuWiki.
