* Tools

  + GUI creator:  Simple drag'n'drop editor using Allegro's GUI.  Save GUIs
    as text files (may be XML?) and as Pascal unit.

* Rotate sprite/bitmap

  Just make it run, even if it's "ugly".

* UNICODE

  Actually supported but there's some problems with it.  Should find a way to
  integrate it with FPC/Lazarus UNICODE support (i.e. utf8string, etc.)

* Examples & documentation

  The idea is to complete the documentation specially adding more "See also"
  sections and some code snipets in some parts.

  Also more examples, specially one or two to show how to integrate Allegro.pas
  in Lazarus projects and may be others.

* New installation system via fpmake and/or fpcmake.
