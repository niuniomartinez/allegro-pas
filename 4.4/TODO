* MIDI:
  + load_ibk

* Audio stream (all).

* Tools

  + GUI creator:  Simple drag'n'drop editor using Allegro's GUI.  Save GUIs
    as text files (may be XML?) and as Pascal unit.

* UNICODE

  Actually supported but there's some problems with it.  Should find a way to
  integrate it with FPC/Lazarus UNICODE support (i.e. utf8string, etc.)

* New installation system via fpmake and/or fpcmake.
