  You use OpenGL for your rendering to the screen, and Allegro for
  miscellaneous tasks like gathering input, doing timers, getting
  cross-platform portability, loading data, and drawing your textures.  So this
  library fills the same hole that things like glut do.

     option generally accelerate graphics operations when
     @link(al_gl_set_allegro_mode) and @link(al_gl_unset_allegro_mode) are
     often called.))
   System with few video memory should use @code(AL_GL_RELEASE) while others
   should use @code(AL_GL_KEEP) since it allows the internal texture to be
   created once.  Default value is @code(AL_GL_KEEP). *)
  AL_GL_VIDEO_MEMORY_POLICY = $00100000;
(* Define multisample parameters.  Some OpenGL ICDs expose an extension called
   @code(GL_ARB_multisample) which provides a mechanism to anti-alias all GL
   primitives:  points, lines, polygons, bitmaps and pixel rectangles.

   In order to get an AllegroGL mode which supports multisample, you have to
   set both @code(AL_GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS) to 1 and @link(AL_GL_SAMPLES) to the
   number of desired samples for multisampling.

   Notice however that since this feature relies on several extensions
   (@code(GL_ARB_multisample) and @code(GLX_ARB_multisample) or
   @code(WGL_ARB_multisample)), it isn't guaranteed that AllegroGL will find a
   graphics mode that supports multisample:  many not-so-old video cards, like
   the GeForce 2, do not support multisampling

   Hence, if you want your app to be able to run on most platforms, you should
   not require this parameter.

   Set this value to 1 to enable multisampling.

(* Sets a configuration option.

   Use this routine to configure the framebuffer, @bold(before) setting a
   graphics mode.  Options are integer constants, and all values are
   effectively integers.

   Three of the options are special.  @link(AL_GL_SUGGEST) and
   @link(AL_GL_REQUIRE) are used to mark which of the other options are merely
   suggestions and which are absolute requirements.  If the OpenGL
   implementation can't provide a feature which you mark with
   @code(AL_GL_REQUIRE), the call to @link(al_set_gfx_mode) will fail.  If you
   don't mark an option as either suggested or required, that option will be
   ignored (@link(AL_GL_DONTCARE)). You can @code(OR) together the other
   constants when using one of these three options to indicate your preferences
   for several settings at one time.  Selecting an option as one of the
   suggestion modes will remove it from the others.  For example, if you first
   set the color depth to be required, but then decide that you want it to be
   suggested instead, then the option will be removed from the required
   settings.  Setting any option to @code(AL_GL_DONTCARE) will remove any
   previous setting attributed to it, and default values will be used if
   necessary.

   The remaining options are: @link(AL_GL_RED_DEPTH), @link(AL_GL_GREEN_DEPTH),
   @link(AL_GL_BLUE_DEPTH), @link(AL_GL_ALPHA_DEPTH), @link(AL_GL_COLOR_DEPTH),
   @link(AL_GL_ACC_RED_DEPTH), @link(AL_GL_ACC_GREEN_DEPTH),

   configuration you are requesting, or afterwards to find out what settings

(* Uploads an Allegro @link(AL_BITMAP) to the GL driver as a texture.

  The bitmap must be a memory bitmap (note that it can be a subbitmap).

  Each bitmap will be converted to a single texture object, with all its size
  limitations imposed by the video driver and hardware.

  The bitmap should conform to the size limitations imposed by the video
  driver.  That is, if @code(ARB_texture_non_power_of_two) is not supported,
  then the bitmap must be power-of-two sized.  Otherwise, AllegroGL will pick
  the best format for the bitmap.

  The original bitmap will @bold(not) be modified.

  AllegroGL will create a texture with the specified texel format.  The texel
  format should be any of the valid formats that can be specified to
  @code(glTexImage2D).  No validity checks will be performed by AllegroGL.  If
  you want AllegroGL to automatically determine the format to use based on the
  bitmap, use -1 as the format specifier.

  A valid GL Rendering Context must have been established, which means you
  cannot use this function before having called @link(al_set_gfx_mode) with a
  valid OpenGL mode.

  @bold(Important note:)  on 32 bit bitmap in RGBA mode, the alpha channel
  created by Allegro is set to all 0 by default.  This will cause the texture
  to not show up in 32bpp modes if alpha is set.  You will need to fill in the
  alpha channel manually if you need an alpha channel.
  @param(bmp The bitmap to be converted to a texture.)
  @param(flags Controls how the texture is generated.  It can be a logical

(* Flips the front and back framebuffers.

  If you chose, or were given, a double buffered OpenGL mode, you have access
  to a front buffer, which is visible on the screen, and also a back buffer,
  which is not visible.  This routine flips the buffers, so that the contents
  of the back buffer is now the contents of the (visible) front buffer.  The
  contents of the backbuffer is undefined after the operation.

  Normally in these modes you would do all your drawing to the back buffer,
  without the user seeing the image while it's partially drawn, and then call
  this function to flip the buffers, allowing the user to see what you've
  drawn, now that it's finished, while you proceed to draw the next frame.

  When drawing to the screen bitmap, you may not be drawing to what user
  currently sees on his monitor.  It is recommended that you rebuild the screen
  every frame, then flip, then draw again.
