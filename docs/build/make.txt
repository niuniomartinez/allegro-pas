
  This document explains how to compile Allegro.pas documentation, examples and
  demonstration game using the "make" tool and Free Pascal compiler.  Read
  "fpc.txt", "lazarus.txt" or "delphi.txt" to know how to use such compilers
  and IDEs.

  Before to use Allegro.pas you must install Allegro itself.  If you didn't
  yet, please read the appropriate document for your operating system.

  Note that makefiles included works only for Free Pascal.  Right now Delphi's
  "make" utility isn't compatible with Free Pascal's one (wich is GNU compliant)
  but in future releases a Delphi makefiles would be included.

The make chain
--------------

  This package includes a make chain that builds all examples, demonstration
  and documentation from the package:

  - makefile:      the initial make file, it defines several variables to
                   identify directories and set up compiler options.  It also
                   "calls" the other files of the chain.

  - makefile.list: this is an script that searchs and clasifies the source
                   files.

  - makefile.all:  This is where the things actually happens, defining the
                   operations needed to build everything.

  "makefile" is the only file you need to modify if you want to modify the
  compilation configuration.  That file is quite simple, as it just defines
  some variables/macros (name = value).  The whole file includes a lot of
  comments so it should be quite autoexplanatory.  Don't be afraid and take a
  look into it.

  By default the make chain compiles the examples and the demonstration game
  with simple optimizations.



Compilation
-----------

  To compile examples, open a console, go to the directory where Allegro.pas is
  and execute "fix.sh" (on Linux), "fix.bat" or "fix.cmd" (on Windows) and
  follow on-screen instructions to configure.  Then run "make".

  To build the documentation you need pasdoc (you can find it here:
  https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki) and run "make docs".

  You can use "make help" for a list of all supported operations.
