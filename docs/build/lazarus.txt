
  This document explains how to use Allegro.pas with the Lazarus IDE. For
  Delphi read "delphi.txt".

  Before to use Allegro.pas you must install Allegro itself.  If you didn't
  yet, please read the appropriate document for your operating system.

  You should read "fpc.txt" too as Lazarus uses Free Pascal internally.

Compiling examples and demonstration game
-----------------------------------------

  There are "lazarus" subdirectories in both examples and demonstration
  directories.  Inside there are Lazarus projects for each of them.  Load with
  your IDE and just compile.  Executables are dropped at the "~/bin" directory.
  These projects are configured to build optimized versions.  Don't forget to
  check the debug and optimization options in the "Project options..." dialog.



Creating a new game project
---------------------------

  To create a new project using Allegro.pas you can use the
  New...>Project>Simple Program option.  Don't use New...>Project>Application
  because for some reason the LCL doesn't like Allegro (I suspect there's
  something with threads involved).

  There's no package for Allegro.pas (may be you can provide one if you find
  it useful) but you can add the unit files as explained in the "fpc.txt" file.

  To know about compilation options, read the "fpc.txt" file.  It is also
  recommendable to read "makefile.txt" file.



Windows manifest
----------------

  If you're using Windows please don't check any of the "Use manifest file to
  enable themes", "Enabled DPI Awareness (for Vista+)" or "UI Access (uiAccess)"
  checkboxes at the "Options for Project" dialog.  Follow the instructions at
  "fpc.txt" instead.
