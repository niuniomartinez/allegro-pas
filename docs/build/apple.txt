
Despite Allegro works in Apple operating system (iOS and MacOS) and Free Pascal
and Delphi are able to build executables for them, Allegro.pas doesn't work on
such systems[*].  The problem is some initialization code needed by Allegro
that can't be reached due the way Free Pascal links the libraries.

If you try and succeed, please let me know and I'll update it.

[*] Actually it was tested with Free Pascal only.  Delphi wasn't tested yet.
