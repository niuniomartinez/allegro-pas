
  Since Allegro works on MacOS systems, Allegro.pas should too.  Unfortunatelly
  I have not a working MacOS system so I have no way to test it.  Anyway, it
  should be quite strightforward.

  If you're brave enough, here you have some advices that should help:

  Download and install Allegro in your system.  Allegro includes all
  explanations you'll need and you may ask at the forums or the mailing lists.
  You can read "linux.txt" as both GNU/Linux and MacOS are POSIX alike.
  Visit http://liballeg.org for downloading and more information.

  Now, if you try to compile any of the Allegro.pas examples you should see the
  next error message:

  ** Allegro.pas wasn't tested with this Operating System.  Do you want to help?

  So, to make it work you should do some changes to Allegro.pas by yourself:

  * If you're using the given makefiles, you should add MacOS as target.  To do
    so, open "makefile" and copy one of the given targets, and change it to
    DARWIN (for example) and change the definitions to fit the MacOS
    environment.  You should take a look to "fix.sh" too, or you can create the
    "target.os" file by yourself with next content:

TARGET=DARWIN

  * Open file "lib/allegro5.cfg" and add MacOS as supported operating system at
    the end of the file (you'll see both Windows and Linux there).  For
    FPC/Lazarus use "DARWIN".  Read Delphi's documentation to know wich symbol
    does it use to identify MacOS.
  * Using either "lib/al5_win.cfg" or "lib/al5_unix.cfg" as a guide, create an
    "al5_macos.cfg" compiler configuration file.  This is, assign
    _A5_LIB_PREFIX_ and _A5_LIB_EXT_ properly so they can be used to identify
    the appropriate dylib files.  See how such constants are used in
    al5base.pas.
  * Open file "lib/al5base.pas" and edit next lines:

{$IF DEFINED(UNIX)}
  {$INCLUDE al5_unix.inc}
{$ELSEIF DEFINED(LINUX)}
  {$INCLUDE al5_unix.inc}
{$ELSEIF DEFINED(WINDOWS)}
  {$INCLUDE al5_win.inc}
{$ELSEIF DEFINED(DARWIN)}
  {$INCLUDE al5_macos.inc}
{$ENDIF}

  * Cross fingers and compile.

  If it doesn't work may be you should change some of the data types declared
  at al5base.pas.  Also you may need to change files "fpc.cfg" or "dcc.cfg"
  (depending on the compiler you're using) to make it work.

  As I've said, I haven't a working MacOS system to test, so I can't help more.
  If you can, let me know.
