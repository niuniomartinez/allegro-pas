  Since Allegro works on Android systems, Allegro.pas should too.
  Unfortunatelly I never made anything for Android so I have no idea how does
  it work (I've read a few tutorials and I find it ridiculously complex, by the
  way).

  If you have some experience with Android may be you can do it.  Read the
  "macos.txt" file as it includes some tips and hints about how to modify
  Allegro.pas.
