
  This document explains how to use Allegro.pas with Delphi. For Lazarus read
  "lazarus.txt".  For Free Pascal read "fpc.txt".

  Before to use Allegro.pas you must install Allegro itself.  If you didn't
  yet, please read the appropriate document for your operating system.

  Also note that Allegro.pas was tested ONLY with Delphi 10.2 Tokio Sarter
  Edition.  We tried to make it compatible with most Delphi versions available
  but if you're using another version it may not work as expected.  You can
  help us to fix any problem by sharing your experience.  See README file to
  know how to contact with developers.

Compiling examples and demonstration game
-----------------------------------------

  There are "delphi" subdirectories in both examples and demonstration
  directories.  Inside there are Delphi projects for each of them.  Load with
  your IDE and just compile.  Executables are dropped at the "~/bin" directory.

  NOTE: All examples compile except ex_fileslice and ex_saw.  All the ones that
	compile run except ex_camera, ex_prim and ex_projection.  I have not
	much experience with Delphi (last one I used was Delphi 6) so I don't
	know how to fix them, but I'm still working on them.  If you find what
	are the problems, let me know.



Creating a new game project
---------------------------

  To create a new project using Allegro.pas create a "console" project.  I
  haven't use Allegro.pas along with VCL or Firemonkey so I have no idea if it
  works or bad things may happen.  Experience with Lazarus (FCL and LCL) says
  that it would not work due to incompatible thread management.

  All units needed to use Allegro.pas are in the "~/lib" directory.  You'll
  need all "pas", "inc" and "cfg" files.  You can copy such directory to your
  project's one and then add the units to your project.



Linking with Allegro debug version
----------------------------------

  If you are working in an add-on or modifying Allegro.pas, may be you want to
  use the "debug" version of Allegro.  To do so, you must define "DEBUGMODE"
  symbol, this way your programs will link with the "debug" version of Allegro.
  In most cases this isn't necessary.

  Note that may be you must compile Allegro by yourself to obtain the "debug"
  library.



Differences between Delphi, Free Pascal and Lazarus
---------------------------------------------------

  Note that there are language differences between Delphi and Free Pascal (even
  using Free Pascal's Delphi mode) so don't expect that your code is portable
  through both compilers.  See the example sources to see how I've tried to
  write code that work in both compilers.

  Also note STRING management may be problematic.  Free Pascal uses UTF-8 by
  default (CHAR) and Delphi uses UTF-16 by default (WIDECHAR).  Allegro expects
  ASCII/UTF-8 by default, so Delphi compiler may warn about text conversions.
  To reduce the warnings and make it less prone to errors use ANSISTRING.  I'll
  work in this issue.



Windows manifest
----------------

  May be you found that your programs may not work, or they do but a warning
  window appears talking about "Windows execution privileges" or similar.  This
  is because the modern Windows weird permission system.

  To solve this you should add a "manifest" to your programs.  As I've said I
  have few experience with Delphi (and it was Delphi 6!) so I'm not sure how to
  do that.  If you are more experieced, please let me know (see the README file
  to konw how to contact).  Since the manifest is a XML file, may be you can
  use the same one I've created for Free Pascal (read "fpc.txt").
