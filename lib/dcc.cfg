(* Configuration for Delphi Coomand-line Compiler (DCC).

  This file is included by library units to configure the compiler.  It isn't
  neccessary to include it in your projects.

  Note that this code was tested with Delphi Tokio 10.2 Starter Edition only.
  I've tried Delphi 6 proffesional and IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL and I don't see
  how to make it run.  Theoretically it should work with Delphi 7 (as I've
  tried to keep Cieslak's changes) but I haven't a copy so it isn't tested.

  Also I've used a table from Embarcadero's Delphi Wiki.
