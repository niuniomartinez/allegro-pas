   installed.  You don't normally need to bother making an explicit call to
   this function, because it will be called automatically when your program
   exits.

   al_destroy_bitmap will most likely crash.  This might be a problem for
   some Object Pascal programs, depending where the destructors are called.

(* Outputs a message.  Usually you want to use this to report messages to the
   user in an OS independant way when some Allegro subsystem cannot be
   initialised.  But you must not use this function if you are in a graphic
   mode, only before calling @link(al_set_gfx_mode), or after a
   @code(al_set_gfx_mode @(AL_GFX_TEXT@)).  Also, this function depends on a
   system driver being installed, which means that it won't display the message
   at all on some platforms if Allegro has not been initialised correctly.

   On platforms featuring a windowing system, it will bring up a blocking GUI
   message box.  If there is no windowing system, it will try to print the
   string to a text console, attempting to work around codepage differences by
   reducing any accented characters to 7-bit ASCII approximations. Example:

@longcode(#
  IF NOT al_init THEN
    EXIT (1);
  IF NOT init_my_data THEN
  BEGIN
    al_message ('Sorry, missing game data!\n');
    EXIT (2);
  END;
  #) *)
  PROCEDURE al_message (CONST msg: STRING);

(* On platforms that have a close button, this routine installs a callback
   function to handle the close event.  In other words, when the user clicks
   the close button on your program's window or any equivalent device, the
   function you specify here will be called.

   This function should not generally attempt to exit the program or save any
   data itself.  The function could be called at any time, and there is usually
   a risk of conflict with the main thread of the program.  Instead, you should
   set a flag during this function, and test it on a regular basis in the main
   loop of the program.

   Pass @nil as the `proc' argument to this function to disable the close
   button functionality, which is the default state.

   Example:

@longcode(#
VAR
  CloseButtonPressed: BOOLEAN = FALSE;

PROCEDURE CloseButtonHandler; CDECL;
BEGIN
  ClosePuttonPressed := TRUE;
END;

    ...
  al_init;
  al_set_close_button_callback (@CloseButtonHandler);

   Although you can change the text format on the fly, this is not a good

   language translations, are loaded when you call @link(al_init), so if you
   change the encoding format after this, they will be in the wrong format, and

(* When you select the @link(AL_U_ASCII_CP) encoding mode, a set of tables are
   used to convert between 8-bit characters and their Unicode equivalents.  You
   can use this function to specify a custom set of mapping tables, which
   allows you to support different 8-bit codepages.

   Allegro will use the @code(table) parameter when it needs to convert an
   ASCII string to an Unicode string.  But when Allegro converts an Unicode
   string to ASCII, it will use both parameters.  First, it will loop through
   the @code(table) parameter looking for an index position pointing at the
   Unicode value it is trying to convert (ie. the @code(table) parameter is
   also used for reverse matching).  If that fails, the @code(extras) list is
   used.  If that fails too, Allegro will put the character @code(`^'), giving
   up the conversion.

   Note that Allegro comes with a default parameters set internally.  The
   default @code(table) will convert 8-bit characters to @code(`^').  The
   default @code(extras) list reduces Latin-1 and Extended-A characters to 7
   bits in a sensible way (eg. an accented vowel will be reduced to the same
   vowel without the accent).
   @param(table Points to an array of 256 short integers, which contain the
     Unicode value for each character in your codepage.)
   @param(extras If not @nil, points to a list of mapping pairs, which will be
     used when reducing Unicode data to your codepage.  Each pair consists of a
     Unicode value, followed by the way it should be represented in your
     codepage.  The list is terminated by a zero Unicode value.  This allows
     you to create a many->one mapping, where many different Unicode characters
     can be represented by a single codepage value @(eg. for reducing accented
     vowels to 7-bit ASCII@).)

   calling the @link(al_set_color_depth) function), otherwise it will be left
   in the same format as the disk file, leaving you to convert it manually
   before the graphic can be displayed.  The default mode is total conversion,
   so that all images will be loaded in the appropriate format for the current
   video mode. Valid bit flags are:

   For convenience, the following macros can be used to select common
   combinations of these flags:
   @longcode(#
          AL_COLORCONV_EXPAND_256          // expand 256-color to hi/truecolor

   #)
   If you enable the @code(AL_COLORCONV_DITHER) flag, dithering will be
   performed whenever truecolor graphics are converted into a hicolor or
   paletted format, including by the @link(al_blit) function, and any
   automatic conversions that take place while reading graphics from disk.
   This can produce much better looking results, but is obviously slower than a
   direct conversion.

   If you intend using converted bitmaps with functions like
   @link(al_masked_blit) or @link(al_draw_sprite), you should specify the
   @code(AL_COLORCONV_KEEP_TRANS) flag.  It will ensure that the masked areas
   in the bitmap before and after the conversion stay exactly the same, by
   mapping transparent colors to each other and adjusting colors which would be
   converted to the transparent color otherwise.  It affects every
   @code(al_blit) operation between distinct pixel formats and every automatic
   conversion.

(* Switches into graphics mode.  The card parameter should usually be one of
   the Allegro magic drivers (read introduction of this unit) or see the
   platform specific documentation for a list of the available drivers.  The
   @code(w) and @code(h) parameters specify what screen resolution you want.
   The color depth of the graphic mode has to be specified before calling this
   function with @link(al_set_color_depth).

   The @code(v_w) and @code(v_h) parameters specify the minimum virtual
   screen size, in case you need a large virtual screen for hardware scrolling
   or page flipping.  You should set them to zero if you don't care about the
   virtual screen size.

   When you call @code(al_set_gfx_mode), the @code(v_w) and @code(v_h)
   parameters represent the minimum size of virtual screen that is acceptable
   for your program.  The range of possible sizes is usually very restricted,
   and Allegro may end up creating a virtual screen much larger than the one
   you request.  Allowed sizes are driver dependent and some drivers do not
   allow virtual screens that are larger than the visible screen at all:  don't
   assume that whatever you pass will always work.

   Currently, using a big virtual screen for page flipping is considered bad
   practice.  There are platforms which don't support virtual screens bigger
   than the physical screen but can create different video pages to flip back
   and forth.  This means that, if you want page flipping and aren't going to
   use hardware scrolling, you should call @code(al_set_gfx_mode) with (0,0)
   as the virtual screen size and later create the different video pages with
   @link(al_create_video_bitmap).  Otherwise your program will be limited to
   the platforms supporting hardware scrolling.

   After you select a graphics mode, the physical and virtual screen sizes can
   be checked with the variables @link(AL_SCREEN_W), @link(AL_SCREEN_H),
   @link(AL_VIRTUAL_W), and @link(AL_VIRTUAL_H).

   back and forth between two non-overlapping areas of the virtual screen.
   Note that to draw outside the original position in the screen bitmap you
   will have to alter the clipping rectangle with @link(al_set_clip_rect).

   Mode-X scrolling is reliable and will work on any card, other drivers may not
   work or not work reliably.  See the platform-specific section of the docs for
   more information.

   prevents them from getting any input messages, so you must be sure to
   release all your bitmaps before using any timer, keyboard, or other
   non-graphics routines!

   Note that if you are using hardware accelerated VRAM->VRAM functions, you
   should not call @code(al_acquire_bitmap).  Such functions need an unlocked
   target bitmap under DirectX, so there is now just the opposite case from
   before - if the bitmap is already locked with @code(al_acquire_bitmap), the
   drawing operation has to unlock it.

   @bold(Note:) For backwards compatibility, the unlocking behavior of such
   functions is permanent.  That is, if you call @code(al_acquire_bitmap)
   first, then call e.g. an accelerated blit, the DirectX bitmap will be
   unlocked internally (it won't affect the nesting counter of acquire/release
   calls).

   There is no clear cross-platform way in this Allegro version to know which
   drawing operations need a locked/unlocked state.  For example a normal
   rectfill most probably is accelerated under DirectX, and therefore needs the
   screen unlocked, but an @code(XOR) rectfill, or one with blending
   activated, most probably is not, and therefore locks the screen. And while
   the DirectX driver will do automatic unlocking, there is no such thing under
   X11, where the function is used to synchronize X11 calls from different
   threads.  Your best bet is to never use @code(al_acquire_bitmap) - changes
   are you are doing something in the wrong way if you think you need it.

   @bold(Warning:) This function can be very dangerous to use, since the whole
   program may get locked while the bitmap is locked.  So the lock should only
   be held for a short time, and you should not call anything but drawing
   operations onto the locked video bitmap while a lock is in place.
   Especially don't call things like @link(al_show_mouse) (or
   @link(al_scare_mouse) which calls that) or @link(al_readkey), since it will
   most likely deadlock your entire program.

   function supports BMP, LBM, PCX, and TGA files, determining the type from

   If the file contains a truecolor image, you must set the video mode or call
   @link(al_set_color_conversion) before loading it.  In this case, if the
   destination color depth is 8-bit, the palette will be generated by calling
   @link(al_generate_optimized_palette) on the bitmap;  otherwise, the
   returned palette will be generated by calling @link(al_generate_332_palette)

   The @code(pal) argument may be @nil.  In this case, the palette data are
   simply not returned.  Additionally, if the file is a truecolor image and the
   destination color depth is 8-bit, the color conversion process will use the
   current palette instead of generating an optimized one.

   The most common use for this function is to just call it once at the
   beginning of the program to tell it to display the system cursor inside the
   Allegro window.  The return value can be used to see if this succeeded or
   not.  On some systems (e.g. DirectX fullscreen) this is not supported and
   the function will always fail, and in other cases only some of the cursors
   will work, or in the case of @link(AL_MOUSE_CURSOR_ALLEGRO), only certain
   bitmap sizes may be supported.

   You never should use @code(al_show_os_cursor) together with the function
   @code(al_show_mouse) and other functions affecting it
   (@code(al_select_mouse_cursor), @code(al_enable_hardware_cursor),
   @link(al_disable_hardware_cursor), @link(al_scare_mouse),
   @link(al_unscare_mouse)).  They implement the standard high level mouse API,
   and don't work together with this low level function.

     returns, or @false otherwise.) *)

    drawing the mouse pointer yourself.  Other possible uses include the
    ability to pause your game when the mouse goes off of the window, or only

     Each pixel in the pattern bitmap is compared with the mask color, which is
     zero in 256-color modes or bright pink for truecolor data (maximum red and
     blue, zero green).  If the pattern pixel is solid, a pixel of the color you
     passed to the drawing routine is written to the destination bitmap,
     otherwise a zero is written.  The pattern is thus treated as a monochrome
     bitmask, which lets you use the same pattern to draw different shapes in
     different colors, but prevents the use of multicolored patterns. *)

     blender functions (for truecolor modes).  Because it involves reading as
     well as writing the bitmap memory, translucent drawing is very slow if you
     draw directly to video RAM, so wherever possible you should use a memory
     bitmap instead. *)

(* Sets the graphics drawing mode.  This only affects the geometric routines
   like @link(al_putpixel), lines, rectangles, circles, polygons, floodfill,

   With the patterned modes, you provide a pattern bitmap which is tiled across
   the surface of the shape.  Allegro stores a pointer to this bitmap rather
   than copying it, so you must not destroy the bitmap while it is still
   selected as the pattern.  The width and height of the pattern must be powers
   of two, but they can be different, eg. a 64x16 pattern is fine, but a 17x3
   one is not.  The pattern is tiled in a grid starting at point
   @code(@(x_anchor, y_anchor@)).  Normally you should just pass zero for these
   values, which lets you draw several adjacent shapes and have the patterns
   meet up exactly along the shared edges.  Zero alignment may look peculiar if
   you are moving a patterned shape around the screen, however, because the
   shape will move but the pattern alignment will not, so in some situations
   you may wish to alter the anchor position.

(* Copies a rectangular area of the source bitmap to the destination bitmap.

   of the area to copy from the source bitmap, and @code(dest_x) and
   @code(dest_y) are the corresponding position in the destination bitmap. This
   routine respects the destination clipping rectangle, and it will also clip
   if you try to blit from areas outside the source bitmap.

   You can blit between any parts of any two bitmaps, even if the two memory
   areas overlap (ie. source and dest are the same, or one is sub-bitmap of the
   other).  You should be aware, however, that a lot of SVGA cards don't
   provide separate read and write banks, which means that blitting from one
   part of the screen to another requires the use of a temporary bitmap in
   memory, and is therefore extremely slow.  As a general rule you should avoid
   blitting from the screen onto itself in SVGA modes.

   If the @link(AL_GFX_HW_VRAM_BLIT) bit in the @link(al_gfx_capabilities)

   Unlike most of the graphics routines, @code(al_blit) allows the source and
   destination bitmaps to be of different color depths, so it can be used to
   convert images from one pixel format to another.  In this case, the behavior

  If the @link(AL_GFX_HW_VRAM_BLIT_MASKED) bit in the
  @link(al_gfx_capabilities) flag is set, the current driver supports hardware
  accelerated sprite drawing when the source image is a video memory bitmap or
  a sub-bitmap of the screen.  This is extremely fast, so when this flag is set
  it may be worth storing some of your more frequently used sprites in an
  offscreen portion of the video memory.

  @bold(Warning:)  if the hardware acceleration flag is not set,
  @code(al_draw_sprite) will not work correctly when used with a sprite image
  in system or video memory so the latter must be a memory bitmap.

  Although generally not supporting graphics of mixed color depths, as a
  special case this function can be used to draw 256-color source images onto
  truecolor destination bitmaps, so you can use palette effects on specific
  sprites within a truecolor program.

   The size of each character is determined by the layout of the image, which
   should be a rectangular grid containing all the ASCII characters from space
   (32) up to the tilde (126).  The way the characters are separated depends on
   the color depth of the image file:

   )
   Note that in each horizontal row the bounding boxes around the characters
   should align and have the same height.

   Probably the easiest way to get to grips with how this works is to load up
   the @code(demo.dat) file and export the @code(TITLE_FONT) into a PCX file.
   Have a look at the resulting picture in your paint program:  that is the
   format a font should be in.

   Take care with high and true color fonts:  Allegro will convert these to the
   current color depth when you load the font.  If you try to use a font on a
   bitmap with a different color depth Allegro will do color conversions on the
   fly, which will be rather slow.  For optimal performance you should set the
   color depth to the color depth you want to use before loading any fonts.

   voices, subsequent calls to @code(al_install_sound) will fail.  How many
   voices are available depends on the driver, and in some cases you will
   actually get more than you reserve (eg. the FM synth drivers will always
   provide 9 voices on an OPL2 and 18 on an OPL3, and the SB digital driver
   will round the number of voices up to the nearest power of two).  Pass
   negative values to restore the default settings.  You should be aware that
   the sound quality is usually inversely related to how many voices you use,
   so don't reserve any more than you really need.

  PROCEDURE al_reserve_voices (digi_voices, midi_voices: AL_INT);
    CDECL; EXTERNAL ALLEGRO_SHARED_LIBRARY_NAME NAME 'reserve_voices';

(* By default, Allegro will play a centered sample at half volume on both the
   left and right channel.  A sample panned to the far right or left will be
   played at maximum volume on that channel only.  This is done so you can play
   a single panned sample without distortion.  If you play multiple samples at
   full volume, the mixing process can result in clipping, a noticeable form of
   distortion.  The more samples, the more likely clipping is to occur, and the
   more clipping, the worse the output will sound.

   If clipping is a problem - or if the output is too quiet - this function can
   be used to adjust the volume of each voice.  You should first check that
   your speakers are at a reasonable volume, Allegro's global volume is at
   maximum (see @link(al_set_volume)), and any other mixers such as the Volume
   Control are set reasonably.  Once you are sure that Allegro's output level
   is unsuitable for your application, use this function to adjust it.

   Each time you increase the parameter by one, the volume of each voice will
   halve.  For example, if you pass 4, you can play up to 16 centred samples at
   maximum volume without distortion.

   If you pass 0 to this function, each centred sample will play at the maximum
   volume possible without distortion, as will all samples played through a
   mono driver.  Samples at the extreme left and right will distort if played
   at full volume.  If you wish to play panned samples at full volume without
   distortion, you should pass 1 to this function.

   Of course this function does not override the volume you specify with
   @link(al_play_sample) or @code(al_set_volume).  It simply alters the
   overall output of the program.  If you play samples at lower volumes, or if
   they are not normalised, then you can play more of them without distortion.

   It is recommended that you hard-code the parameter into your program, rather
   than offering it to the user.  The user can alter the volume with the
   configuration file instead, or you can provide for this with
   @code(al_set_volume).
