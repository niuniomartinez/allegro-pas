(*<Defines an API that allows to use native dialogs and menus in a
   cross-platform way.  This includes message dialogs, file choosers, main
   menu and more.

   You should not use these dialogs if your app is running in full-screen
   modes.

   Note that this isn't integrated with VCL, CLX, LCL nor fpGUI packages.
   Integration isn't even planned.
