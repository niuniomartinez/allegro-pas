  @bold(3D maths)

  Allegro contains some 3d helper functions for manipulating vectors,
  constructing and using transformation matrices, and doing perspective
  projections from 3d space onto the screen.  It is not, and never will be, a
  fully fledged 3d library (the goal is to supply generic support routines, not
  shrink-wrapped graphics code :-) but these functions may be useful for
  developing your own 3d code.

  Allegro uses a right-handed coordinate system, i.e. if you point the thumb of
  your right hand along the x axis, and the index finger along the y axis, your
  middle finger points in the direction of the z axis.

  Allegro's world coordinate system typically has the positive x axis right,
  the positive y axis up, and the positive z axis in to the screen.  What all
  this means is this:  Assume, the viewer is located at the origin (0/0/0) in
  world space, looks along the negative z axis (0/0/1), and is oriented so up
  is along the positive y axis (0/1/0).  Then something located at
  (100/200/300) will be 100 to the right, 200 above, and 300 in front of the
  viewer.  Just like in OpenGL.  (Of course, both OpenGL and Allegro allow to
  use a different system.)

  @bold(See also) @link(al_set_projection_viewport) @link(al_get_camera_matrix)
  @link(al_persp_project)

  All the 3d math functions are available in two versions:  one which uses
  fixed point arithmetic, and another which uses floating point.  The syntax
  for these is identical, but the floating point functions and structures are
  postfixed with @code('_f'), eg. the fixed point function
  @code(al_cross_product) has a floating point equivalent
  @code(al_cross_product_f).

  3d transformations are accomplished by the use of a modelling matrix.  This
  is a 4x4 array of numbers that can be multiplied with a 3d point to produce a
  different 3d point.  By putting the right values into the matrix, it can be
  made to do various operations like translation, rotation, and scaling.  The
  clever bit is that you can multiply two matrices together to produce a third
  matrix, and this will have the same effect on points as applying the original
  two matrices one after the other.  For example, if you have one matrix that
  rotates a point and another that shifts it sideways, you can combine them to
  produce a matrix that will do the rotation and the shift in a single step.
  You can build up extremely complex transformations in this way, while only
  ever having to multiply each point by a single matrix.

  Allegro actually cheats in the way it implements the matrix structure.
  Rotation and scaling of a 3d point can be done with a simple 3x3 matrix, but
  in order to translate it and project it onto the screen, the matrix must be
  extended to 4x4, and the point extended into 4d space by the addition of an
  extra coordinate, w=1.  This is a bad thing in terms of efficiency, but
  fortunately an optimisation is possible. Given the 4x4 matrix:
@longcode(#
   ( a, b, c, d )
   ( e, f, g, h )
   ( i, j, k, l )
   ( m, n, o, p )
#)
  a pattern can be observed in which parts of it do what.  The top left 3x3
  grid implements rotation and scaling.  The three values in the top right
  column (d, h, and l) implement translation, and as long as the matrix is only
  used for affine transformations, m, n and o will always be zero and p will
  always be 1.  If you don't know what affine means, read Foley & Van Damme:
  basically it covers scaling, translation, and rotation, but not projection.
  Since Allegro uses a separate function for projection, the matrix functions
  only need to support affine transformations, which means that there is no
  need to store the bottom row of the matrix.  Allegro implicitly assumes that
  it contains (0,0,0,1), and optimises the matrix manipulation functions
  accordingly.

@bold(Polygon rendering)

  All the 3d functions that accept a @code(type) parameter are asking for a
  polygon rendering mode, which can be any of the @code(POLYTYPE_* ) values.
  If the @code(AL_CPU_MMX) flag of the @link(al_cpu_capabilities) global
  variable is set, the GRGB and truecolor *LIT routines will be optimised using
  MMX instructions.  If the @code(AL_CPU_3DNOW) flag is set, the truecolor
  PTEX*LIT routines will take advantage of the 3DNow! CPU extensions.

  Using MMX for *LIT routines has a side effect:  normally (without MMX), these
  routines use the blender functions used also for other lighting functions,
  set with @link(al_set_trans_blender) or @link(al_set_blender_mode).  The MMX
  versions only use the RGB value passed to @link(al_set_trans_blender) and do
  the linear interpolation themselves.  Therefore a new set of blender
  functions passed to @link(al_set_blender_mode) is ignored.

  @bold(Note:) *LIT polygon types might not work correctly in high color and
  real color graphic modes (i.e. 15, 16, 24 and 32 bits per pixel), when
  iterpolating colors across the polygon.  This is a problem with Allegro, not
  Allegro.pas.  8bpp paletted mode works correctly in all cases.

  @bold(See also) @link(al_polygon3d)

@bold(Zbuffered rendering)

  A Z-buffer stores the depth of each pixel that is drawn on a viewport.  When
  a 3D object is rendered, the depth of each of its pixels is compared against
  the value stored into the Z-buffer:  if the pixel is closer it is drawn,
  otherwise it is skipped.

  No polygon sorting is needed.  However, backface culling should be done
  because it prevents many invisible polygons being compared against the
  Z-buffer.  Z-buffered rendering is the only algorithm supported by Allegro
  that directly solves penetrating shapes (see example exzbuf, for instance).
  The price to pay is more complex (and slower) routines.

  Z-buffered polygons are designed as an extension of the normal
  @code(AL_POLYTYPE_* ) rendering styles.  Just OR the POLYTYPE with the value
  @link(AL_POLYTYPE_ZBUF), and the normal @link(al_polygon3d),
  @link(al_polygon3d_f), @link(al_quad3d), etc. functions will render
  z-buffered polygons.

  Example:
  @longcode(#
    al_polygon3d (bmp, AL_POLYTYPE_ATEX OR AL_POLYTYPE_ZBUF, tex, vc, vtx);
  #)
  Of course, the z coordinates have to be valid regardless of rendering style.

  A Z-buffered rendering procedure looks like a double-buffered rendering
  procedure.  You should follow four steps: create a Z-buffer at the beginning
  of the program and make the library use it by calling @link(al_set_zbuffer).
  Then, for each frame, clear the Z-buffer and draw polygons with
  @code(AL_POLYTYPE_* OR AL_POLYTYPE_ZBUF) and finally destroy the Z-buffer
  when leaving the program.

  Notes on Z-buffered renderers:
  @unorderedList(
    @item(Unlike the normal @link(AL_POLYTYPE_FLAT) renderers, the Z-buffered
      ones don't use the @link(al_hline) routine.  Therefore
      @link(al_drawing_mode) has no effect.)
    @item(The @code( *LIT* ) routines work the traditional way - through the set
      of blender routines)
    @item(All the Z-buffered routines are much slower than their normal
      counterparts (they all use the FPU to interpolate and test 1/z values).)
  )

  @bold(See also) @link(al_create_zbuffer)

@bold(Scene rendering)

  Allegro provides another simple approache to remove hidden surfaces:
  Scan-line algorithms.

  Along each scanline on your screen, you keep track of what polygons you are
  "in" and which is the nearest.  This status changes only where the scanline
  crosses some polygon edge.  So you have to juggle an edge list and a polygon
  list.  And you have to sort the edges for each scanline (this can be
  countered by keeping the order of the previous scanline - it won't change
  much).  The @bold(big) advantage is that you write each pixel only once.  If
  you have a lot of overlapping polygons you can get incredible speeds compared
  to any of the previous algorithms.  This algorithm is covered by the
  @code( *_scene) routines.

  The scene rendering has approximately the following steps:
  @orderedList(
    @item(Initialize the scene (set the clip area, clear the bitmap, blit a
      background, etc.))
    @item(Call @link(al_clear_scene).)
    @item(Transform all your points to camera space.)
    @item(Clip polygons.)
    @item(Project with @link(al_persp_project) or @link(al_persp_project_f).)
    @item("Draw" polygons with @link(al_scene_polygon3d) and/or
      @link(al_scene_polygon3d_f).  This doesn't do any actual drawing, only
      initializes tables.)
    @item(Render all the polygons defined previously to the bitmap with
      @link(al_render_scene).)
    @item(Overlay some non-3D graphics.)
    @item(Show the bitmap (blit it to screen, flip the page, etc).)
  )

  For each horizontal line in the viewport an x-sorted edge list is used to
  keep track of what polygons are "in" and which is the nearest.  Vertical
  coherency is used - the edge list for a scanline is sorted starting from the
  previous one - it won't change much.  The scene rendering routines use the
  same low-level asm routines as normal @code(al_polygon3d).

  Notes on scene rendering:
  @unorderedList(
    @item(Unlike @code(al_polygon3d), @code(al_scene_polygon3d) requires valid
      z coordinates for all vertices, regardless of rendering style @(unlike
      @code(al_polygon3d), which only uses z coordinate for @code ( *PTEX* ).@))
    @item(All polygons passed to @code(al_scene_polygon3d) have to be
      @code(al_persp_project)'ed.)
    @item(After @code(al_render_scene) the mode is reset to
      @code(AL_DRAW_MODE_SOLID).)
  )

  Using a lot of @code( *MASK* ) polygons drastically reduces performance,
  because when a MASKed polygon is the first in line of sight, the polygons
  underneath have to be drawn too.  The same applies to @code(AL_POLYTYPE_FLAT)
  polygons drawn with @link(AL_DRAW_MODE_TRANS).

  Z-buffered rendering works also within the scene renderer.  It may be helpful
  when you have a few intersecting polygons, but most of the polygons may be
  safely rendered by the normal scanline sorting algo.  Same as before: just
  @code(OR) the @code(POLYTYPE) with @code(AL_POLYTYPE_ZBUF).  Also, you have
  to clear the z-buffer at the start of the frame.

  @bold(See also) @link(al_create_scene)

@bold(Quaternion math)

  Quaternions are an alternate way to represent the rotation part of a
  transformation, and can be easier to manipulate than matrices. As with a
  matrix, you can encode a geometric transformations in one, concatenate
  several of them to merge multiple transformations, and apply them to a
  vector, but they can only store pure rotations. The big advantage is that you
  can accurately interpolate between two quaternions to get a part-way
  rotation, avoiding the gimbal problems of the more conventional Euler angle
  interpolation.

  Quaternions only have floating point versions, without any _f suffix. Other
  than that, most of the quaternion functions correspond with a matrix function
  that performs a similar operation.

  Quaternion means 'of four parts', and that's exactly what it is. Here is the
  structure:
@longcode(#
  AL_QUAT = RECORD
    w, x, y, z: AL_FLOAT;
  END;
#)
  You will have lots of fun figuring out what these numbers actually mean, but
  that is beyond the scope of this documentation. Quaternions do work -- trust
  me.

  pre-existing z-buffer, but possibly with a different size.  The same rules as
  for sub-bitmaps apply:  the sub-z-buffer width and height can extend beyond
  the right and bottom edges of the parent (they will be clipped), but the
  origin point must lie within the parent region.

  When drawing z-buffered to a bitmap, the top left corner of the bitmap is
  always mapped to the top left corner of the current z-buffer.  So this
  function is primarily useful if you want to draw to a sub-bitmap and use the
  corresponding sub-area of the z-buffer.  In other cases, eg. if you just want
  to draw to a sub-bitmap of screen (and not to other parts of screen), then
  you would usually want to create a normal z-buffer (not sub-z-buffer) the
  size of the visible screen.  You don't need to first create a z-buffer the
  size of the virtual screen and then a sub-z-buffer of that.

(*****************************************************************************
 * draw.inl
 *)

(* Draw 3d polygons onto the specified bitmap, using the specified rendering
  mode.  This routine don't support concave or self-intersecting shapes, and
  it can't draw onto mode-X screen bitmaps (if you want to write 3d code in
  mode-X, draw onto a memory bitmap and then @link(al_blit) to the
  @link(al_screen)).  The width and height of the texture bitmap must be powers
  of two, but can be different, eg. a 64x16 texture is fine, but a 17x3 one is
  not.  The vertex count parameter (@code(vc)) should be followed by an array
  containing the appropriate number of pointers to @link(AL_V3D) structures.

  How the vertex data is used depends on the rendering mode:

  The @code(x) and @code(y) values specify the position of the vertex in 2D
  screen coordinates.

  The @code(z) value is only required when doing perspective correct texture
  mapping, and specifies the depth of the point in 3D world coordinates.

  The @code(u) and @code(v) coordinates are only required when doing texture
  mapping, and specify a point on the texture plane to be mapped on to this
  vertex.  The texture plane is an infinite plane with the texture bitmap
  tiled across it.  Each vertex in the polygon has a corresponding vertex on
  the texture plane, and the image of the resulting polygon in the texture
  plane will be mapped on to the polygon on the screen.

  We refer to pixels in the texture plane as @italic(texels).  Each texel is a
  block, not just a point, and whole numbers for @code(u) and @code(v) refer to
  the top-left corner of a texel.  This has a few implications.  If you want to
  draw a rectangular polygon and map a texture sized 32x32 on to it, you would
  use the texture coordinates (0,0), (0,32), (32,32) and (32,0), assuming the
  vertices are specified in anticlockwise order.  The texture will then be
  mapped perfectly on to the polygon.  However, note that when we set u=32, the
  last column of texels seen on the screen is the one at u=31, and the same
  goes for v.  This is because the coordinates refer to the top-left corner of
  the texels.  In effect, texture coordinates at the right and bottom on the
  texture plane are exclusive.

  There is another interesting point here.  If you have two polygons side by
  side sharing two vertices (like the two parts of folded piece of cardboard),
  and you want to map a texture across them seamlessly, the values of u and v
  on the vertices at the join will be the same for both polygons.  For example,
  if they are both rectangular, one polygon may use (0,0), (0,32), (32,32) and
  (32,0), and the other may use (32,0), (32,32), (64,32), (64,0).  This would
  create a seamless join.

  Of course you can specify fractional numbers for u and v to indicate a point
  part-way across a texel.  In addition, since the texture plane is infinite,
  you can specify larger values than the size of the texture.  This can be used
  to tile the texture several times across the polygon.

  The @code(c) value specifies the vertex color, and is interpreted differently
  by various rendering modes. Read the description of the @code(AL_POLYTYPE_* )
  constants for details.
