@section(1 intro Introduction)

  Allegro.pas is a wrapper to allow Pascal compilers (such as Free Pascal or
  Delphi) to use the Allegro library.

  Read @link(use_allegro section "How to use Allegro.pas") for a description of
  the main module of the library.

  There are a few add-ons that adds some functionality to the original Allegro.
  They came with their own documentation and makefiles at the @code(addons)
  directory.

  There are a wiki at Allegro.pas website (http://allegro-pas.sf.net/) which
  may include additional documentation and tutorials.

  If you want to collaborate please join the main Allegro.pas mailing list
  or ask at Pascal Game Development forum.  Read @link(contact section "Contact
  info").


@section(1 use_allegro How to use Allegro.pas)

  The best way to start with Allegro.pas is to study the sources at examples
  and look for detailed description of procedures and functions at the
  documentation.  That examples are fully commented and should be easy to
  understand.

  Anyway, here you have a brief description of the Allegro library:

    @item(@bold(@link(rlespr Run-length compressed sprites)))
    @item(@bold(@link(sound Sound and music routines)))
  )

@section(2 init Initialization and finalization)

  You @bold(must) call either @link(al_install) or @link(al_init) before doing
  anything other than using the @link(unicode UNICODE routines).

  On the other hand, you can call @link(al_exit) before to finish the program
  to close Allegro.  You don't need to do it because it will be called
  automaticly by the @code(FINALIZATION) section of Allegro.pas but some times
  it's neccessary to call it before.


@section(2 unicode UNICODE routines)

  Allegro can manipulate and display text using any character values from 0
  right up to 2^32-1 (although the current implementation of the @link(grabber)
  can only create fonts using characters up to 2^16-1).  You can choose between
  a number of different text encoding formats, which controls how strings are
  stored and how Allegro interprets strings that you pass to it, using the
  @link(al_set_uformat) procedure.  This setting affects all aspects of the
  system:  whenever you see a function that returns a @code(STRING) or
  @code(AL_STRptr) type, or that takes the same as an argument, that text will
  be in whatever format you have told Allegro to use.

  By default, Allegro uses UTF-8 encoded text (@code(AL_U_UTF8)).  This is a
  variable-width format, where characters can occupy anywhere from one to four
  bytes.  The nice thing about it is that characters ranging from 0-127 are
  encoded directly as themselves, so UTF-8 is upwardly compatible with 7-bit
  ASCII (@code('Hello, World!') means the same thing regardless of whether you
  interpret it as ASCII or UTF-8 data).  Any character values above 128, such
  as accented vowels, the UK currency symbol, and Arabic or Chinese characters,
  will be encoded as a sequence of two or more bytes, each in the range
  128-255.  This means you will never get what looks like a 7-bit ASCII
  character as part of the encoding of a different character value, which makes
  it very easy to manipulate UTF-8 strings.

  There are a few editing programs that understand UTF-8 format text files.
  Alternatively, you can write your strings in plain ASCII or 16-bit Unicode
  formats, and then use the Allegro @code(textconv) program to convert them
  into UTF-8.  The @code(textconv) program is included with the original
  Allegro release.

  If you prefer to use some other text format, you can set Allegro to work with
  normal 8-bit ASCII (@code(AL_U_ASCII)), or 16-bit Unicode
  (@code(AL_U_UNICODE)) instead, or you can provide some handler functions to
  make it support whatever other text encoding you like (for example it would
  be easy to add support for 32 bit UCS-4 characters, or the Chinese GB-code
  format).

  There is some limited support for alternative 8-bit codepages, via the
  @code(AL_U_ASCII_CP) mode.  This is very slow, so you shouldn't use it for
  serious work, but it can be handy as an easy way to convert text between
  different codepages.  By default the @code(AL_U_ASCII_CP) mode is set up to
  reduce text to a clean 7-bit ASCII format, trying to replace any accented
  vowels with their simpler equivalents (this is used by the @link(al_message)
  function when it needs to print an error report onto a text mode DOS screen).
  If you want to work with other codepages, you can do this by passing a
  character mapping table to the @link(al_set_ucodepage) function.

  Note that you can use the Unicode routines before you call @link(al_install)
  or @link(al_init).  If you want to work in a text mode other than UTF-8, it
  is best to set it with @link(al_set_uformat) just before you call these.

  @bold(Note:)  While UNICODE is almost supported by Free Pascal and Lazarus,
  you might have bad results using it with Allegro.pas.  See the TODO file
  for more information.



@section(2 configuration Configuration routines)

  Various parts of Allegro, such as the sound routines and the
  @link(al_load_joystick_data) function, require some configuration
  information.  This data is stored in text files as a collection of
  @code(variable=value) lines, along with comments that begin with a @code(#)
  character and continue to the end of the line.  The configuration file may
  optionally be divided into sections, which begin with a @code([sectionname])
  line.  Each section has a unique namespace, to prevent variable name
  conflicts, but any variables that aren't in a section are considered to
  belong to all the sections simultaneously.

  Note that variable and section names cannot contain spaces.

  By default the configuration data is read from a file called
  @code(allegro.cfg), which can be located either in the same directory as the
  program executable, or the directory pointed to by the @code(ALLEGRO)
  environment variable.  Under Unix, it also checks for @code(~/allegro.cfg),
  @code(~/.allegrorc), @code(/etc/allegro.cfg), and @code(/etc/allegrorc), in
  that order;  under BeOS only the last two are also checked.  MacOS X also
  checks in the Contents/Resources directory of the application bundle, if any,
  before doing the checks above.

  If you don't like this approach, you can specify any filename you like with
  using procedure @link(al_set_config_file), or use a block of binary
  configuration data with @link(al_set_config_data) provided by your program
  (which could for example be loaded from a @link(al_load_datafile datafile)).

  You can store whatever custom information you like in the config file, along
  with the standard variables that are used by Allegro.  Allegro (but not
  Allegro.pas) comes with a @code(tools/setup) directory where you can find
  configuration programs.  The standalone setup program is likely to be of
  interest to final users.  It allows any user to create an @code(allegro.cfg)
  file without the need to touch a text editor and enter values by hand.  It
  also provides a few basic tests like sound playing for sound card testing.
  You are welcome to include the setup program with your game, either as is or
  with modified graphics to fit better your game.

@section(2 timer Timer routines)

  Allegro can set up several virtual timer functions, all going at different
  speeds.

  They are usually implemented using threads, which run parallel to the main
  thread.  Therefore timer callbacks on such platforms will not block the main
  thread when called, so you may need to use appropriate synchronisation
  devices (eg. mutexes, semaphores, etc.) when accessing data that is shared by
  a callback and the main thread.  (Currently Allegro does not provide such
  devices.)

  @bold(See also) @link(al_install_int)

@section(2 keyboard Keyboard routines)

  The Allegro keyboard handler provides both buffered input (@link(al_readkey))
  and a set of flags storing the current state of each key (@link(al_key)).
  Note that it is not possible to correctly detect every combination of keys,
  due to the design of the PC keyboard.  Up to two or three keys at a time will
  work fine, but if you press more than that the extras are likely to be
  ignored (exactly which combinations are possible seems to vary from one
  keyboard to another).

  Allegro.pas comes with a prepackaged @code(keyboard.dat) file at the
  @code(resources) directory which you can put along with your binary.  If
  this file is present, Allegro will be able to extract the keyboard mapping
  information stored there.  However, the end user still needs to select which
  keyboard mapping to use.  This can be accomplished through the keyboard
  variable of the system section in a standard @code(allegro.cfg) configuration
  file.  Read section about @link(configuration) for more information about
  this.

  @bold(See also) @link(al_install_keyboard)

@section(2 joystick Joystick support)

  Unlike keyboard or mouse input, which are usually read through hardware
  interrupts by Allegro, joystick input functions have to be polled because
  there are no hardware interrupts for them on most platforms.  This doesn't
  mean that you have to poll the joysticks on each line of code you want to
  read their values, but you should make sure to poll them at least once per
  frame in your game loop.  Otherwise you face the possibility of reading stale
  incorrect data.

  @bold(See also) @link(al_install_joystick)

@section(2 color Color)

  All the Allegro drawing functions use integer parameters to represent colors.

  In 256-color mode the color values are treated as indexes into the current
  palette, which is a table listing the red, green and blue intensities for
  each of the 256 possible colors.

  Palette entries are stored in an @link(AL_RGB) structure, which contains red,
  green and blue intensities in the VGA hardware format, ranging from 0-63.
  The full palette is an @link(AL_PALETTE), a list of 256 @code(AL_RGB)
  values.  You can set the palette using the @link(al_set_palette) procedure.

  In a truecolor video mode the red, green, and blue components for each pixel
  are packed directly into the color value, rather than using a palette lookup
  table.  In a 15-bit mode there are 5 bits for each color, in 16-bit modes
  there are 5 bits each of red and blue and six bits of green, and both 24 and
  32-bit modes use 8 bits for each color (the 32-bit pixels simply have an
  extra padding byte to align the data nicely).  The layout of these components
  can vary depending on your hardware, but will generally either be RGB or BGR.
  Since the layout is not known until you select the video mode you will be
  using, you must call @link(al_set_gfx_mode) before using any of the color
  routines!

  @bold(See also) @link(alvga) @link(alblend)

@section(2 bitmap Bitmaps)

  Once you have selected a graphics mode, you can draw things onto the display
  via the @link(al_screen) bitmap.  All the Allegro graphics routines draw onto
  @link(AL_BITMAP) structures, which are areas of memory containing rectangular
  images, stored as packed byte arrays (in 8-bit modes one byte per pixel, in
  15- and 16-bit modes two bytes per pixel, in 24-bit modes 3 bytes per pixel
  and in 32-bit modes 4 bytes per pixel).  You can create and manipulate
  bitmaps in system RAM, or you can write to the special @code(al_screen)
  bitmap which represents the video memory in your graphics card.

  Allegro supports several different types of bitmaps:
  @unorderedList(
    @item(The @link(al_screen) bitmap, which represents the hardware video
	memory.  Ultimately you have to draw onto this in order for your image
	to be visible.  It is destroyed by any subsequent calls to
	@link(al_set_gfx_mode), so you should never attempt to destroy it
	yourself.)
    @item(Memory bitmaps, which are located in system RAM and can be used to
	store graphics or as temporary drawing spaces for double buffered
	systems.  These can be obtained by calling @link(al_create_bitmap),
	@link(al_load_bitmap), or by loading a @link(grabber) datafile.)
    @item(Sub-bitmaps.  These share image memory with a parent bitmap (which
	can be the screen, a video or system bitmap, a memory bitmap, or
	another sub-bitmap), so drawing onto them will also change their
	parent.  They can be of any size and located anywhere within the parent
	bitmap, and can have their own clipping rectangles, so they are a
	useful way of dividing a bitmap into several smaller units, eg.
	splitting a large virtual screen into multiple sections.
	@bold(Warning:) Make sure not to destroy a bitmap before all of its
	sub-bitmaps, otherwise bad things will happen when you try to access
	one of these sub-bitmaps.  Are created by the
	@link(al_create_sub_bitmap) function.)
    @item(Video memory bitmaps.  These are created by the
	@link(al_create_video_bitmap) function, and are usually implemented as
	sub-bitmaps of the screen object.  They must be destroyed by
	@link(al_destroy_bitmap) before any subsequent calls to
	@code(al_set_gfx_mode).)
    @item(System bitmaps.  These are created by the
	@link(al_create_system_bitmap) function, and are a sort of halfway
	house between memory and video bitmaps.  They live in system memory,
	so you aren't limited by the amount of video ram in your card, but they
	are stored in a platform-specific format that may enable better
	hardware acceleration than is possible with a normal memory bitmap (see
	the @link(AL_GFX_HW_SYS_TO_VRAM_BLIT) and
	@link(AL_GFX_HW_SYS_TO_VRAM_BLIT_MASKED) flags in
	@link(al_gfx_capabilities)).  System bitmaps must be accessed in the
	same way as video bitmaps, using the bank switch functions and
	@code(bmp_write* ) macros.  Not every platform implements this type of
	bitmap:  if they aren't available, @code(al_create_system_bitmap) will
	function identically to @code(al_create_bitmap).  They must be
	destroyed by @code(al_destroy_bitmap) before any subsequent calls to
	@code(al_set_gfx_mode).)
    )



@section(2 mouse Mouse routines)

  Allegro provides functions for reading the mouse state and displaying a mouse
  cursor on-screen.  You can read the absolute position of the mouse and the
  state of the mouse buttons from global variables.  Additionally, you can read
  the mouse position difference as mouse mickeys, which is the number of pixels
  the cursor moved since the last time this information was read.

  Allegro offers three ways to display the mouse cursor:
  @definitionList(
    @itemLabel(Standard Allegro cursor)@item(Allegro is responsible for drawing
      the mouse cursor from a timer.  Use @link(al_set_mouse_sprite) and
      @link(al_show_mouse) to define your own cursor and display it on the
      screen.  You need to call @link(al_scare_mouse)/@link(al_unscare_mouse)
      to hide the mouse cursor whenever you draw to the screen.)
    @itemLabel(Custom operating system cursor @(hardware cursor@))
    @item(Allegro will let the operating system draw the mouse cursor.  Use
      @code(al_set_mouse_sprite) and @code(al_show_mouse) @(or
      @link(al_show_os_cursor)@) to define your own cursor and display it on
      the screen.  Not all graphics drivers are capable of this and some may
      only be able to display cursors up to a certain size.  Allegro will fall
      back on its own cursor drawing if it cannot let the OS handle this.  On
      some platforms, the hardware cursor is incompatible with
      @link(al_get_mouse_mickeys) and it is therefor disabled by default.  In
      such cases you need to call @link(al_enable_hardware_cursor) to enable it
      explicitly.)
    @itemLabel(Default operating system cursor)@item(Allegro will not draw its
      own cursor, but use the operating system default cursor.  You can use the
      @link(al_select_mouse_cursor) function to select the cursor shape to
      display.  As with custom operating system cursors, you need to call
      @link(al_enable_hardware_cursor) before you can use this.  Or you can use
      the low level @link(al_show_os_cursor) function.)
  )
  Not all drivers will support all functionality.



  @section(2 graphmode Graphics modes initialization)

  Graphics modes are the common denominator for most Allegro programs.  While
  it is possible to write platform specific programs using Allegro which don't
  set a graphic mode through the routines provided in this unit, these are not
  very common.

  The first thing to note is that due to the wide range of supported platforms,
  a graphic mode is the only way to safely communicate with the user.  When
  Allegro was a DOS only library (versions 3.x and previous), it was frequent
  for programmers to use functions from the runt-time library to communicate
  with the user, like calling @code(WriteLn) before setting a graphic mode or
  maybe @code(GetLn) to read the user's input.  However, what would happen for
  such a game running under Windows where there is no default console output or
  it may be hidden from the user?  Even if the game compiled successfully, it
  would be unplayable, especially if there was vital information for the user
  in those text only messages.

  Allegro provides the @link(al_message) function to deal with this problem,
  but this is not a very user friendly method of communicating with the user
  and its main purpose is displaying small error like messages when no graphic
  mode is available.  Therefore, the first thing your Allegro program should do
  is set a graphic mode, and from there on, use Allegro's text output routines
  to display messages to the user, just like
  @code(allegro.pas/examples/exhello.pp) does.

  Setting a graphic mode involves deciding how to allocate the memory of the
  video card for your program.  On some platforms this means creating a virtual
  screen bigger than the physical resolution to do hardware scrolling or page
  flipping.  Virtual screens can cause a lot of confusion, but they are really
  quite simple.  @bold(Warning:)  patronising explanation coming up, so you may
  wish to skip the rest of this paragraph.  Think of video memory as a
  rectangular piece of paper which is being viewed through a small hole (your
  monitor) in a bit of cardboard.  Since the paper is bigger than the hole you
  can only see part of it at any one time, but by sliding the cardboard around
  you can alter which portion of the image is visible.  You could just leave
  the hole in one position and ignore the parts of video memory that aren't
  visible, but you can get all sorts of useful effects by sliding the screen
  window around, or by drawing images in a hidden part of video memory and then
  flipping across to display them.

  For example, you could select a 640x480 mode in which the monitor acts as a
  window onto a 1024x1024 virtual screen, and then move the visible screen
  around in this larger area (hardware scrolling).  Initially, with the visible
  screen positioned at the top left corner of video memory, this setup would
  look like:
  @longcode(#
          (0,0)------------(640,0)----(1024,0)
            |                  |           |
            |  visible screen  |           |
            |                  |           |
          (0,480)----------(640,480)       |
            |                              |
            |   the rest of video memory   |
            |                              |
          (0,1024)--------------------(1024,1024)
  #)
  With a virtual screen bigger than the visible screen you can perform smooth
  CPU inexpensive scrolling:  you draw your graphics once, and then only tell
  the video card to show a different portion of the screen.  However, virtual
  screens are not supported on all platforms, and on some they might be
  emulated through software, losing any performance.  On top of that, many
  video cards only allow horizontal scrolling in steps of 32 bytes.  This is
  not a problem if your game runs in 24 or 32 bit, but it tends to mean jerky
  scrolling for other color depths.

  The other reason you could use virtual screens for is page flipping.  This
  means showing one portion of the virtual screen while your program draws to
  the hidden one. When you finish, you show the part you have been drawing to
  and repeat the process with the area now hidden. The result is a perfectly
  smooth screen update without flickering or other graphical artifacts.

  Scrolling manually to one part of the video memory is one non portable way to
  accomplish this. The portable way is to use functions like
  @link(al_create_system_bitmap), @link(al_create_video_bitmap),
  @link(al_show_video_bitmap), etc.  These functions divide the memory of the
  video card in areas and switch between them, a feature supported on all
  platforms and video cards (given that they have enough memory for the screen
  resolutions you asked for).

  The last thing you need to know about setting a graphic mode are drivers.
  Each platform has a number of graphic drivers which support a different range
  of hardware or behave in different ways.  To avoid cluttering your own code
  with #ifdefs and dealing with drivers added after you release your program,
  Allegro provides several so called magic drivers.  These magic drivers don't
  really exists, they wrap around a specific kind of functionality.

  The magic drivers you can use are:  @link(AL_GFX_AUTODETECT),
  @link(AL_GFX_AUTODETECT_FULLSCREEN), @link(AL_GFX_AUTODETECT_WINDOWED),
  @link(AL_GFX_SAFE), @link(AL_GFX_TEXT).

  @bold(See also) @link(al_set_gfx_mode)



@section(2 draw_primitives Drawing primitives)

  Except for @link(_al_putpixel), all these routines are affected by the
  current drawing mode and the clipping rectangle of the destination bitmap.
  Unless specified otherwise, all coordinates for drawing operations are
  inclusive, and they, as well as lengths, are specified in pixel units.

  @bold(See also) @link(al_set_clip_rect) @link(al_drawing_mode)



@section(2 text text drawing)

  Allegro provides routines for loading fonts directly from GRX format .fnt
  files, 8x8 or 8x16 BIOS format .fnt files, from bitmap images, from datafiles
  or you can import a multiple-range Unicode font by writing a .txt script that
  specifies a number of different source files for each range of characters.

  By default, Allegro can only use bitmapped (non-scalable) fonts.  If you want
  to use TrueType fonts, you will need to use an add-on library which allows
  you to load them on the fly (like AllegTTF or Glyph Keeper, listed among
  others at http://www.allegro.cc/) and render them directly, or generate a
  bitmapped version of a TrueType font with tools like TTF2PCX
  (http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/ttf2pcx/index.html).

  Allegro provides text output routines that work with both monochrome and
  color fonts, which can contain any number of Unicode character ranges.  The
  @link(grabber) program can create fonts from sets of characters drawn in a
  bitmap file, and can also import GRX or BIOS format font files.

  @bold(See also) @link(al_load_font) @link(al_textout_ex)



@section(2 bltspr Bitting and sprite drawing)

  As far as Allegro is concerned, a bitmap and a sprite are the same thing, but
  to many people the two words imply slightly different things.  The function
  @link(al_draw_sprite) is called so rather than @code(al_draw_bitmap) partly
  because it indicates that it uses a masked drawing mode (if it existed, you
  could expect @code(al_draw_bitmap) to be a simple block copy), and partly for
  historical reasons.  In Allegro 1.0 there were actually different structures
  for sprites and bitmaps, each with their own set of abilities.  Allegro 2.0
  merged these into a single more flexible structure, but retained some names
  like @code(al_draw_sprite).

  In wider (non-Allegro) terms, the two words can mean quite different things.
  Generally you can say that sprites are a subset of bitmaps, but even that
  isn't true in 100% of cases.
  @definitionList(
    @itemlabel(BITMAP)@item(a widely accepted term that will be understood by
      anyone even remotely connected with computer graphics.  It simply means
      an image built up from a grid of pixels, ie. just about any picture that
      you are likely to come across on a computer @(vector graphics formats are
      the exception, but those must be rendered into a bitmap format before
      they can be displayed by most hardware@).  A more accurate term but
      slightly rarer term with the same meaning is "pixmap" @(pixel-map@).)
    @itemlabel(SPRITE)@item(a particular usage of bitmapped images, restricted
      to video games @(other types of programmer probably won't be familiar
      with this term@).  Originally on machines like the C64, sprites were a
      hardware feature that allowed a number of small bitmap images to be
      loaded into special registers, and they could then be superimposed over
      the main graphics display and moved around just by modifying the position
      register.  They were used for the moving objects @(player and enemy
      characters@), and enabled the C64 to do much more impressive things than
      would have been possible if all the drawing had to be done directly by
      the puny CPU.)
  )
  Later on, a lot of old C64 programmers upgraded to machines like the Atari
  ST, which didn't have any special sprite hardware, but they carried on
  referring to their main moving objects as sprites (the routine to draw such a
  thing would obviously be called @code(al_draw_sprite)).  A sprite is really
  just a bitmap graphic which is drawn onto the screen, but when you call it a
  sprite rather than a bitmap, this suggests it is a gameplay element that can
  move freely around the world rather than being a static part of the
  environment, and that it will be drawn in a masked overlay mode rather than
  as a solid rectangle (there is also a strong implication that a sprite will
  be animated by cycling through a number of frames, but that isn't always the
  case).

  In recent years some people have started using "sprite" to refer to any
  character graphics, even if they are not in fact drawn as 2d bitmaps, eg.
  @italic("this game uses 3d polygonal player sprites"). This is a confusing
  misuse of the word (Doom uses sprites, Quake does not), but it does happen.

  The origin of the term @italic(blit) is also rather interesting.  This was
  originally BitBlt, an abbreviation of BITmap BLock Transfer, which was a
  function designed (possibly) by the people at Xerox who did so much of the
  pioneering work on graphics display systems, and subsequently copied by
  virtually everybody doing computer graphics (the Microsoft Windows GDI still
  provides a BitBlt function with identical functionality to the original).
  This routine was a workhorse for all sorts of drawing operations, basically
  copying bitmap graphics from one place to another, but including a number of
  different ROP modes (Raster OPerations) for doing things like XOR, inverting
  pixels, etc.  A whole family of related words grew up around the BitBlt
  function, but "blt" is impossible to speak (try saying "bltter" or "bltting"
  :-) so people added the vowel to make it easier to pronounce.

  Therefore, the act of calling the BitBlt function came to be known as
  @italic("doing a blit").  The obvious next step was to rename the function
  itself to @code(blit), which generally took place at the same time as people
  decided to simplify the original, removing the different ROP modes on the
  grounds that they aren't needed for games coding and don't work well with
  anything higher than monochrome images in any case.  This leaves us with a
  function called @code(blit), which is an abbreviation for @italic("block
  transfer").  A strong case could be made for calling this @code(blot)
  instead, but somehow that just doesn't sound the same!

  Anyway, all the routines in this chapter are affected by the clipping
  rectangle of the destination bitmap.

@section(2 rlespr Run-length compressed sprites)

  Because bitmaps can be used in so many different ways, the bitmap structure
  is quite complicated, and it contains a lot of data.  In many situations,
  though, you will find yourself storing images that are only ever copied to
  the screen, rather than being drawn onto or used as filling patterns, etc.
  If this is the case you may be better off storing your images in
  @link(AL_RLE_SPRITE) structure rather than regular bitmaps.

  RLE sprites store the image in a simple run-length encoded format, where
  repeated zero pixels are replaced by a single length count, and strings of
  non-zero pixels are preceded by a counter giving the length of the solid run.
  RLE sprites are usually much smaller than normal bitmaps, both because of the
  run length compression, and because they avoid most of the overhead of the
  bitmap structure.  They are often also faster than normal bitmaps, because
  rather than having to compare every single pixel with zero to determine
  whether it should be drawn, it is possible to skip over a whole run of zeros
  with a single add, or to copy a long run of non-zero pixels with fast string
  instructions.

  Every silver lining has a cloud, though, and in the case of RLE sprites it is
  a lack of flexibility.  You can't draw onto them, and you can't flip them,
  rotate them, or stretch them.  In fact the only thing you can do with them is
  to blast them onto a bitmap with the @link(al_draw_rle_sprite) function,
  which is equivalent to using @link(al_draw_sprite) with a regular bitmap.
  You can convert bitmaps into RLE sprites at runtime, or you can create RLE
  sprite structures in @link(grabber) datafiles by making a new object of type
  'RLE sprite'.



@section(2 sound Sound and music routines)

  Allegro allows you to use the sound hardware in two ways:  automatic, or
  manual.  Usually you should try the automatic version first.  This means
  calling @link(al_install_sound) with the autodetection parameters and using
  the rest of the sound functions to play samples or music.  In this situation,
  Allegro will handle the sound devices and mix the samples and/or music the
  best way it can.

  However, sound hardware has a limitation on the number of samples it may play
  all at the same time (from now on, called hardware voices).  When you exceed
  this limit, Allegro will cut off one of the samples being played and
  reproduce the new one.  Depending on the type of sounds you are playing, how
  many of them you need at the same time and their nature (e.g: vital audio
  feedback to the user or useless "ping" when some shrapnel hits a rock in the
  scenery) you will want to specify more carefully how hardware voices are
  reserved and which samples have priority over others.

  The hardware voice reservation phase has to be done before the call to
  @link(al_install_sound), since it directly affects how Allegro talks to the
  sound drivers.

  Allegro allows you to play MIDI files.  MIDI files basically contain notes
  and the type of instrument that is meant to play them, so they are usually
  very small in size.  However, it's up to the sound card of the end user to
  play the notes, and sound cards have been historically known to have poor
  MIDI performance (at least those oriented to the consumer market).  Few
  consumer cards feature decent MIDI playback.  Still, as a game creator you
  can never be sure if the music of your game will be played as you meant it,
  because it totally depends on the hardware of the user.

  For this reason Allegro also provides a @link(AL_MIDI_DIGMID) driver.  This
  is a software implementation of the so called Wavetable synthesis.  Sound
  cards featuring this store digital samples of real instruments at different
  pitches, interpolating those that are not recorded, thus achieving a high
  sound quality.  Implementing this in software makes you sure that the quality
  you hear on your computer is that which will be heard by end users using the
  same driver.

  The disadvantage of the @code(AL_MIDI_DIGMID) driver is that it uses more CPU
  than simple MIDI playback, and it steals some hardware voices from the sound
  card, which might be more critical for the end user experience than the
  background music . At the Allegro.pas wiki
  (http://allegro-pas.sourceforge.net/) you can find more information about
  @code(AL_MIDI_DIGMID) and where to download and create digital samples for
  your MIDI files.

  Allegro also allows the use of digital samples.
