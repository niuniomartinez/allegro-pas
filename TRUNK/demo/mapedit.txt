                         Map editor
                         ==========

This program allows you to create and modify maps for the
Allegro's Demo Game.  It's designed in a way that should be
easy to modify, so you can use it in your own projects.
Read the "README" file to know how.

Loading or creating a new map
-----------------------------

Tile selector
-------------

  On the bottom of the window there's the list of available
  tiles.  The leftmost is the "remove" tile, the two on its
  right are the start and end markers.  Note that each map
  should have only one start and one end points!

  Use the arrows (black triangles) to browse the list of
  all tiles.

  You can select the tiles directly with mouse or use
  arrow keys and PgUp and PgDown keys (when in focus).


Brush selector

  The seven glyphs below the map are the brush selectors.
  Experiment with them to know the different effects.
