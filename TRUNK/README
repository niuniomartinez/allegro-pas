Introduction
============

  Allegro.pas is a wrapper to allow Pascal compilers (such as Free Pascal)
  to use the Allegro library.

  Note that Allegro 5 is wholly *incompatible* with Allegro 4 and earlier
  versions, and so Allegro.pas is, but both may be installed at the same time
  without conflicts.

  This is a WIP (beta) version of the Allegro.pas 5 version.  It is released
  to show what's done and to allow developers to test it and give feed-back.
  Please go to the Allegro.pas' project site at sourceforge to look for more
  versions.

  Current version was tested with Free Pascal on WindowsXP, Windows7 and
  GNU/Linux, both 32bit and 64 bit, and with Delphi Tokio Starter Edition on
  Windows 7 32bit.  Other operating systems and compilers weren't tested.

  The goal is to make Allegro.pas 5 compatible with any operating system
  supported by Allegro, which are Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS and Android.
  AFAIK all these OS have Pascal compilers.

  As this is a WIP version you should remember that at the moment not all
  functionality are implemented.

  + Event manager, including but not limited to keyboard, mouse, timer and
    display.

====================
Installation and use
====================

  Installation and use is different depending on the operating system and
  compiler you're using.  To make things more easy, I've wrote different
  documents for each one you can find in the ~/docs/build directory.  For
  example, read "windows.txt to know how to get and install Allegro in your
  Windows, then read "lazarus.txt" to know how to use it with the Lazarus IDE.

  For Lazarus and Free Pascal users it is recommendable to read the
  "makefile.txt" file too.



Documentation
=============

  At the moment the library documentation isn't complete, but includes most of
  the library.  You can build it (read ~/docs/build/docs.txt) or download them
  from the webpage (see Contact info).  If you need more complete documentation
  you can use the original Allegro documentation at http://liballeg.org/.

  Also, there are a collection of examples and a demonstration game.  Open them
  and read the code.  Some have a lot of comments that explains it.
