Changes between versions 5.0 alpha and 5.2 alpha
================================================

  Bugfixing
  ---------
  + Water animation in example ex_haiku fixed, but earth still doesn't work.
  - Removed OpenGL dependency from a5image and al5primitives, it looks like
    bug was fixed.

  News
  ----
  + A lot of new stuff added in all units (still unfinished).
  + New examples added.

  API changes
  -----------
  * Data types defined at al5base revisited, as done in version 4.4.5.  This
    should fix a few issues and help with Delphi compatability.
  * Timer conversion functions (i.e. ALLEGRO_MSECS_TO_SECS, etc) receibe

  * Few data types changed from "enums" and "sets" to simple INTEGER constants.

  Other
  -----

Changes in version 5.0 alpha
============================

  This version changes from Allegro 4 to Allegro 5, with a fully redesigned
  API.  It was rewritten almost from scratch, so there's no changelog.



Changes between versions 4.4.4 and 4.4.5
========================================

  Bugfixing
  ---------
  * A lot of changes in "alstream" extension.
  * Example exalpha runs correctly now.  The problem was it used 16bit variable
    instead of 32bit one.
  * Some times, the demonstration game and the map editor didn't load the
    datafile.  Also, if the game wasn't able to load it, the message was an
    EAccessViolation.  Now they work properly.
  * Fixed al_apply_matrix_f.  Note that it looks like a bug in FreePascal!
  * Fixed al_pack_fseek.
  * Fixed some issues with timers on several examples.  Also, default graphics
    mode is windowed now in some of them.

  News
  ----
  + New extension alGUI.
  + The example ex3d is more complex.
  + Added runtime identification of operating system, graphic modes (color
    depth and resolution), and digital sound and MIDI.
  + Added al_request_refresh_rate and al_get_refresh_rate.
  + Added identifiers for several Linux and Windows drivers.
  + Added procedures for Windows and UNIX/Linux.
  + Added console switching.

  API changes
  -----------
  + Added another BOOLEAN type (8 bit), so now al_key can be checked as logic
    value avoiding the use of "<> 0".  Also, a lot of functions and procedures
    use this new type, so you'll be forced to change your old code,
    but it worth it:  Smaller, faster and cleaner!
  * Datafile type objects are constants now.  This way it's faster (again!),
    uses less memory and they can be used as CASE labels.
  * A lot of procedures changed theyr "POINTER" parameters to "VAR" or "OUT".
    This way you don't need to use the "@" operator.  Also removes a lot of
    "HINT" messages from compiler.
  * Digital fields of joysticks are AL_BOOL now.
    NOTE:  I'm not able to test joysticks (my Fedora doesn't like my
    arcade-style joystick :_( ) so I don't know if it actually works.
    Please, let me know if you can test it.
  * Some functions use now "inverse logic", that may be better:
    + al_scene_plolygon3d<_f>
    + al_request_scroll
    + al_request_video_bitmap
  * Some GUI procedures use ARRAY OF... instead of pointers now.

  Other
  -----
  * A lot of changes on documentation.  Also, it's build from the main makefile
    instead of use it's own makefile.
  - A lot of wrapper procedures and functions.  Now the C function is called
    directly.
  * Procedures _al_pupixel* and _al_getpixel* rewritten to work with pointers
    instead of integers, avoiding weird conversions (I still don't like to play
    with pointers on Pascal anyway).
  * Programming style revised in some places.



Changes between versions 4.4.3 and 4.4.4
========================================

  * Changed parameter of al_xor_mode from INTEGER to BOOLEAN.
  * Changed return values of al_save_*_pf from INTEGER to BOOLEAN.

    animation.  Also I've added a block to the 3th map to make it less
    impossible ;) .
  * Optimised property "UseZBuff" of "TCube".
  * Now example "ex3d" sows several cubes and shows how to create fog.
