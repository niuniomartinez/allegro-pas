Try to implement actual "radio-buttons", but using TalGUI_CustomItemListControl
as base class.  I've always feel that is a better way to do it.

Add property "FocusControl" to TalGUI_Label, so if it's clicked then it passes
focus to such control.

"Slider factor calculation" should be in the custom slider.

Add scroll bar to list box.

Add control to deal with window close button(?).
