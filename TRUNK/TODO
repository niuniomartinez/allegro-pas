New features
============

 * Documentation.
 * UNICODE.  Actually supported but there's some problems with it.
   Should find a way to integrate it with FPC/Lazarus UNICODE support
   (i.e. utf8string, etc.)
 * Audio stream (all).
 * Load MIDI using IFF instead of current.  This way we can add a "packed"
   version of loader.
 * Sound recording/input.

Other
=====
 * Revisit the "classic" alGUI unit.
 * Check Windows alleg44.dll build parameters.  Be sure it's optimised.
