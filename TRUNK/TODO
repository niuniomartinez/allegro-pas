* Check _al_putpixel32 implementation.

* Test al_arc routine.

* Use "FINALIZATION" to call "al_exit".

* Revise list of examples.

* Check Windows alleg44.dll build parameters.  Be sure it's optimised.

+ Complete explanation of Joystick. i.e. problems with configuration file.

* Change some parameters from "POINTER" to "VAR ARRAY OF..." (i.e: polygons).  I've checked it passes data correctly to C.

* MIDI:
  + load_ibk

* Audio stream (all).

* UNICODE

  Actually supported but there's some problems with it.  Should find a way to
  integrate it with FPC/Lazarus UNICODE support (i.e. utf8string, etc.)

* New installation system via fpmake and/or fpcmake.
