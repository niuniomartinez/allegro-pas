* Make exampe "ex3d" similar to the original one, adding more cubes, adding
  "fog" to the TCube class and sorting by Z axis.

* Some functions don't return the correct value:
 - al_getpixel (see exalpha and compare with the original C version).

* Check Windows alleg44.dll build parameters.  Be sure it's optimised.

+ Complete explanation of Joystick. i.e. problems with configuration file.

* MIDI:
  + load_ibk

* Audio stream (all).

* UNICODE

  Actually supported but there's some problems with it.  Should find a way to
  integrate it with FPC/Lazarus UNICODE support (i.e. utf8string, etc.)
