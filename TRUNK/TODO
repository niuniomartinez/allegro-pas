New features
============

 * UNICODE.  Actually supported but there's some problems with it.
   Should find a way to integrate it with FPC/Lazarus UNICODE support
   (i.e. utf8string, etc.)
 * Audio stream (all).
 * Load MIDI using IFF instead of current.  This way we can add a "packed"
   version of loader.
 * Get information about available graphics modes.
 * Display switch modes.
 * Sound recording/input.
 * Add IDs for controllers (Windows and Linux).  This needs new units.
 * Add functions and procedures to deal with specific Windows an Linux API.


Other
=====
 * Change STRING by AL_STR and AL_STRptr, and remove wrapper
   procedures/functions.  Use AL_STR on parameters and AL_STRptr on return
   values.
 * Remove (if possible) the MANY hint messages about C ARRAYs.
 * Check the "inverse logic" used by some functions.  In most cases they're
   "inversed" using NOT but may be it's better not to do that in some cases.
 * Check Windows alleg44.dll build parameters.  Be sure it's optimised.
 + Complete explanation of Joystick. i.e. problems with configuration file.
