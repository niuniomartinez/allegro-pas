BUGS
====
 * Fix al_pack_fseek with workaround at add-on.
 * al_getpixel in exalpha.  Use of 16bit integer instead of 32bit.

New features
============

 * UNICODE.  Actually supported but there's some problems with it.
   Should find a way to integrate it with FPC/Lazarus UNICODE support
   (i.e. utf8string, etc.)
 * al_set_display_switch_mode.
 * Audio stream (all).
 * Load MIDI using IFF instead of current.  This way we can add a "packed"
   version of loader.
 * Get information about available graphics modes.
 * Display switch modes.


Other
=====
 * Change STRING by AL_STR and AL_STRptr, and remove wrapper
   procedures/functions.  Use AL_STR on parameters and AL_STRptr on return
   values.
 * Remove (if possible) the MANY hint messages about C ARRAYs.
 * Check the "inverse logic" used by some functions.  In most cases they're
   "inversed" using NOT but may be it's better not to do that in some cases.
 * Check Windows alleg44.dll build parameters.  Be sure it's optimised.
 + Complete explanation of Joystick. i.e. problems with configuration file.
