 * Preparar "goals" y "milestones".

In no special order

  * Check sizes of BOOLEAN types.  It seems to work (Xubuntu 14.04.4 & WinXP).

  * See the various TODO notes in unit Allegro5.pas.

  * Sometimes it doesn't load samples.
    - It doesn't load on Fedora 64bit, but does on Ubuntu 32bit.
    - Suspect it's a problem with the funcion in C, similar than the problem
      with 3D rendering on Allegro 4.

  * Work to merge Gregor A. Cieslak's fork and test Delphi
    (https://github.com/Soldat/allegro-pas5-test)

  * Add to documentation a note about to define symbol "DEBUGMODE" if using
    "-g".

  * There are some "enum" types (sets). Be sure that they have the correct
    sice in bits & bytes.  Read FPC and Delphi documentation.

  * nihGUI may need some changes in API (i.e. what's public and what's not).

  * nihGUI doesn't calculate mouse position correctly.  This seems to be an
    issue of Allegro in Windows XP.

  * Documentation isn't written.
    May be I should find another documentation tool as pasdoc is "dirty".
    Else use pasdoc.

  * Document COLOR issue (can't use functions "_map_" as parameters in
    Windows (?)).

  * MUST normalize types (VAR vs. POINTER, OUT vs. VAR, STRING vs. PCHAR ...).
