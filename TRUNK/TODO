* Some examples work correctly on 64bit but don't on 32bit:
 - ex3d (fails on 1024 x 768)
 - exkeys
 - exscn3d
 - exstars (press [Ctr] for a while without turning the ship)
 - extrans2
 - exzbuf (face culling only works on 320x240 or less)

* Some functions don't return the correct value:
 - al_getpixel (see exalpha and compare with the original C version).
 - al_apply_matrix_f (currently with a work-araund that seems to fix it).

* Check Windows alleg44.dll build parameters.  Be sure it's optimised.

+ Complete explanation of Joystick. i.e. problems with configuration file.

* MIDI:
  + load_ibk

* Audio stream (all).

* UNICODE

  Actually supported but there's some problems with it.  Should find a way to
  integrate it with FPC/Lazarus UNICODE support (i.e. utf8string, etc.)
