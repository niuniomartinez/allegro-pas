In no special order

  * Check AL_OFF_T data type.

  * Check how to detect GTK+ and do correct compilation in ex_menu.
    Also {$DEFINE} may be useful.  Problem is that I don't see "DEFINES"
    propagates correctly (FPC).  Ask about it.

  * At ALLEGRO_USER_EVENT, I think that data1..data4 should be in an UNION
    that defines them as AL_POINTER and also as AL_ULONG/AL_LONG.

  * al_get_keyboard_state seems to fail in some systems (64bits? Only Xubuntu
    64bit?).

  * ex_prim doesn't work as expected.  The last screen (TIndexedBuffers) 
    affects it in a way that prevents hardware acceleration to work.  If it
    isn't initialized (Create) everything works.

  * Check sizes of BOOLEAN types.  It seems to work (Xubuntu 14.04.4 & WinXP).

  * See the various TODO notes in unit Allegro5.pas.

  * Sometimes it doesn't load samples.
    - It doesn't load on Fedora 64bit, but does on Ubuntu 32bit.
    - Suspect it's a problem with the funcion in C, similar than the problem
      with 3D rendering on Allegro 4.

  * Work to merge Gregor A. Cieslak's fork and test Delphi
    (https://github.com/Soldat/allegro-pas5-test)

  * Add to documentation a note about to define symbol "DEBUGMODE" if using
    "-g".

  * There are some "enum" types (sets). Be sure that they have the correct
    sice in bits & bytes.  Read FPC and Delphi documentation.

  * nihGUI may need some changes in API (i.e. what's public and what's not).

  * Documentation isn't written.
    May be I should find another documentation tool as pasdoc is "dirty".
    Else use pasdoc.
